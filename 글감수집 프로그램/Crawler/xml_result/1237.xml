				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There was something we were doing at Treehouse that made us more money, but just didn&#8217;t feel quite right. We&#8217;ve finally decided to just pull the trigger and take the hit on revenue, because <strong>taking care of our Students is always the right thing to do</strong>.</p>
<p>If you weren’t already aware, Treehouse students have had the option to pause their account for up to 3 months at a time. At the end of that period your account would be automatically unpaused, and you&#8217;d begin paying for your account again.</p>
<p>For those of you that used pausing, the time limit was inconvenient, and introduced unnecessary pressure to unpause before you were ready. Some of you even felt we were being dishonest and charging you without your consent.</p>
<p>We’re excited to announce that pausing your account no longer comes with a time limit! You can now pause your account for as long as you like, and your account will remain paused until you’re ready to come back and learn with us again.</p>
<p>For those of you that were already paused under the old system, your account has been converted to an indefinite pause. If you need to check the status of your account you can do so on your membership settings page.</p>
<p>We appreciate every single one of our 87,000 Students and we&#8217;re going to continue to always try to do the right thing to serve you.</p>
<p>To Infinity and Beyond!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>I recently interviewd </i><a href="https://dribbble.com/mattoxshuler"><i>Mattox Shuler</i></a><i>, a type designer who runs </i><a href="http://fortfoundry.com/"><i>Fort</i></a><i>, his type foundry. Mattox was kind enough to talk to me a bit about his journey to becoming a full time type designer and his new Treehouse course.</i></p>
<p><strong><em>MS:</em> Mattox, let me start by saying I am a huge fan of Fort and your work. I know everyone at Treehouse is incredibly excited for your web typography course to release.<br />
</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>MX:</strong> </em>Thanks so much Matt. I’m honored you guys thought of me for the course. It’s been a lot of fun seeing it all come together.</p>
<p><strong><em>MS:</em> Alright, to get us started why don’t you tell us a little bit about yourself?</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>MX:</strong> </em>My full name is George Mattox Shuler, but the “George” is definitely silent—so I just go by Mattox. I grew up in Georgia and got into design because I was in band, and well, bands need merch. That’s how I got hooked on type.</p>
<p>Design continued to play a background role studied Marketing at the University of Georgia, but I was never formally trained in design. After graduating in 2010, I took some courses through Treehouse which helped me build a solid foundation in web design. I worked for a website that published articles daily and each one needing a nice typographic header. I was scouring the web for good type every day and I decided to see what it takes to make a typeface. I downloaded <a title="Glyphs" href="http://www.glyphsapp.com">Glyphs</a> and was enamored with the process.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10362213/Treehouse%20Interview/treehouse-1.png" alt="" width="505" height="338" /></p>
<p><strong><em>MS: </em>So, you haven’t been doing type design full-time for very long, what was the process of making that jump like? </strong></p>
<p><em><strong>MX:</strong></em> That’s right. I went full time through my personal foundry, <a href="http://fortfoundry.com">Fort</a> back in November of 2013.</p>
<p>The process of making that jump to full-time was interesting. When I first set out to design a font, I wasn’t trying to be a ‘type designer.’ I didn’t know if I thought it was a valid job or not—let alone if you could do it for a living. I knew I liked type, so I thought “Why not try to design a font or two and give ‘em away for free?” Those first feeble efforts as seen below were pretty amusing.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10362213/Treehouse%20Interview/treehouse-2.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="150" /></p>
<p>I had no clue what I was doing and many of the principles l knew from graphic design did not translate well. The upside is that I was having a lot of fun trying.</p>
<p>I eventually decided to release my first professional typeface with the necessary language support, symbols, etc. So I reached out to <a href="http://www.myfonts.com">MyFonts</a> who helped push me in the right direction. I still had my day-job at this point so I did all this on the side. I changed the name to <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fort-foundry/bourbon/">Bourbon</a> and finally put it up for sale.</p>
<p><a href="http://drbl.in/hKPD">Gin</a> was the third font I put up for sale and it was very well received. It made it’s way onto MyFont’s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/newsletters/rs/201306.html">Rising Stars</a> newsletter and it was at that moment I realized I could make a decent living designing and selling type. I was thrilled.</p>
<p>Looking back, I had a lot to learn. Fortunately, I had a passion for it and it paid the bills. I took the leap into full-time type design and I’m grateful to be able to type design for a living.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10362213/Treehouse%20Interview/treehouse-3.png" alt="" width="552" height="292" /></p>
<p><strong><em>MS: </em>Are there any resources you would recommend for anyone who might want to start doing type design?</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>MX:</em></strong> Yes, absolutely!</p>
<p><i>Get This Book: </i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Type-Karen-Cheng/dp/0300111509/"><i>Designing Type</i></a><i> by Karen Cheng.</i> I continue to go back to this book as it’s incredibly helpful for type design. The book details each letter (serif and sans-serif versions) and talks about the intricacies and design of each. It also references different typefaces and how they handle certain characters. I highly recommend it.</p>
<p><i>Download </i><a href="http://www.glyphsapp.com"><i>Glyphs</i></a><i> and Get Familiar with how it works.</i> When I started, I began designing with <a href="http://www.glyphsapp.com/glyphs-mini">Glyphs Mini</a> which was only $45 in Apple’s app store. You can also download a free trial version of the full Glyphs for 30 days which is great because you can figure out if you’re really into type design (it definitely takes a certain personality) without blowing your savings. If you’re familiar with Illustrator, you’ll pick up some things quick, but with any program there’s going to be a learning curve. Glyphs has some <a href="http://www.glyphsapp.com/getting-started">good tutorials</a> over on their site too.</p>
<p><i>Find Some Friends in the Type and Design World.</i> Having a another set of eyes on your work is invaluable. You might miss an awkward part of a letter because your eyes have gotten used to staring and working with the letterforms (typefaces can take weeks to months to years to build). Have someone design with a draft of a font to get their thoughts. It’s friends in the industry who have helped shaped my typefaces to what you see today.</p>
<p><strong><em>MS:</em> Where do you get the inspiration for your fonts?</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>MX: </strong></em>As a kid I despised going to antique stores and sitting around waiting for my parents to find stuff. Now, you can’t get me out ‘em. I love going and perusing through all the old product packaging or painted type on signs. I’ll take pictures and keep an inspiration folder on my phone or laptop that I’m often referencing. There’s so much good stuff and style from back then.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10362213/Treehouse%20Interview/treehouse-4.jpg" alt="" width="314" height="455" /></p>
<p>I’ve also found <a href="http://typehunting.com/">typehunting.com</a> to be really helpful along with seeing what’s going on in the <a href="https://tagboard.com/badgehunting">#badgehunting</a> craze that <a href="http://allanpeters.com/blog/category/badge-hunting/">Allan Peters</a> is pioneering.</p>
<p><strong><em>MS: </em>Ok, here’s a real typical type question: What are your favorite serif and slab serif fonts?</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>MX: </em></strong>Serif-wise, I love Okay Type’s <a href="https://okaytype.com/harriet/series">Harriet Series</a>, and <a href="http://www.houseind.com/fonts/eames">Eames</a> from House Industries is super nice and stylish. Slab-serif-wise, I love the versatility of H&amp;Co’s <a href="http://www.typography.com/fonts/sentinel/overview/">Sentinel</a>, and sometimes you just gotta go with a heavy-hitter like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/ironmonger/">Ironmonger</a> from John Downer.</p>
<p><strong><em>MS: </em>Do you have a process or methodology you use when you create font pairings, especially for web?</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>MX:</em></strong> We talk about a number of different ways to go about this in the course, but I think I naturally gravitate toward pairing typeface with complementary personalities. I’ll read through the content at hand and write down some adjectives describing the tone or mood of it. I’ll then look for typefaces that convey or complement that mood and experiment with a typographic palette of those choices. Check out H&amp;Co’s techniques on <a href="http://www.typography.com/techniques/index.php">Combining Fonts</a>, they’ve got more on it there.</p>
<p><strong><em>MS:</em> Alright, last question: Can you give us any sneak peaks into new fonts you are getting ready to release?</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>MX:</em></strong> Good question. As I’m writing this, I’m actually finishing up a release called Factoria (out now on <a href="http://myfonts.com/fonts/fort-foundry/factoria/">MyFonts</a> and <a href="http://fortfoundry.com/products/factoria">Fort Foundry</a>). It’s what happened when I took my typeface <a href="http://fortfoundry.com/collections/fonts/products/industry">Industry</a> into my underground slaboratory—the place where slabs are fused to letterforms:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10362213/Treehouse%20Interview/treehouse-5.png" alt="" width="564" height="296" /></p>
<p><strong>MS: Mmmm. Hamburgers! Looks great Mattox. Thanks again for taking the time to chat with me!</strong></p>
<p>Stay tuned for Mattox&#8217;s new course coming to Treehouse soon!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the first section of the <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/library/laravel-basics">Laravel Basics Course</a> we install <a href="http://laravel.com/docs/homestead">Laravel Homestead</a> on OS X. Several of our students have requested that the installation procedure for Laravel Homestead on Windows be shown as well. One of the joys of using a virtual machine for our development environment is, once we are setup, the procedure of installing Laravel and continuing development is the same across any platform. This video shows a few errors you may encounter along the way as well as how to solve for them. Enjoy, and feel free to leave a comment here or on our <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/forum/topic:php">Treehouse Forum</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #000000;">Publishing your app on Google Play allows you to share it with users around the world, and maybe even make some money. Publishing your first app can be a little overwhelming, so my new course, <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/library/publish-an-android-app/?cid=1000">Publishing an Android App</a>, will walk you through preparing an Android app and then publishing it on Google Play.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since we launched our <a title="Swift Track" href="http://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/ios-development-with-swift">Swift courses </a>on the day Apple publicly released iOS 8 we have received several emails and tweets asking whether you still need to learn C or Objective-C. Moreover, it seems like people are still confused as to where Swift fits within the iOS Development ecosystem. I hope to clear up some of that confusion and set you on your path to learning.</p>
<p><strong>Should I first learn Objective-C / C or go straight to Swift?</strong><br />
Swift is a brand new language which has nothing to do with Objective-C or C. I mean they are both programming languages and follow some of the fundamental concepts and paradigms but you don&#8217;t need to learn one before you can learn the other. We have designed our Swift track so that anyone with little or no programming experience can learn Swift. So please head on straight to the <a title="Swift Track" href="http://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/ios-development-with-swift">Swift courses</a> and don&#8217;t look back.</p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;m in the midst of learning Objective-C, should I switch to Swift?</strong><br />
That all depends. If you are learning iOS development as a hobby or out of curiosity then drop Objective-C and switch to Swift. Are you pursuing iOS Development as a career? If so, then there are at least 1 million apps out there written in Objective-C. Swift just got released in June 2014 so chances are that your future employer&#8217;s apps will be written in Objective-C. It is essential that you learn Objective-C to get a job as an iOS Developer until Swift becomes a standard, which will take a few years. Until then it would benefit you to learn both the languages. Your future employer might even task you with converting their existing Objective-C app into Swift. Although I would take that notion with a grain of salt because the most important part of an app is its functionality and not the language it is written in. Which means that rewrites of existing apps might not be that prevalent.</p>
<p>I encourage beginners to start out with Swift because it is a familiar language and easy to learn thanks to the playgrounds. Once you have learned Swift then you can always look into learning Objective-C if pursuing iOS Development as a career.</p>
<p>Finally, Swift is a modern language. If you learn Swift then you will be future-proofing yourself by learning a language that is going to be responsible for a whole new generation of apps (Apple Watch anyone?). Apple has provided everyone a gift of a new language. There are no developers with 5 years of experience with Swift. If you start now then in 5 years you could be one of those developers.</p>
<p>My final piece of advice would be to learn one language or the other and get good at it. At the end of the day the language does not matter much, so long as you know how to use the iOS SDK. Once you learn one language you can easily pick up another. The most important thing is so to start learning and practicing now.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/library/modular-css-with-sass">this new course</a>, you&#8217;re going to build a UI toolkit using Sass and many of the best practices and principles of modular CSS architecture. You&#8217;ll learn how a modular approach with Sass can boost your workflow and cut down maintenance by reducing the amount of code you write.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll cover topics such as mixins and functions for writing modular code, the BEM (or Block, Element, Modifier) approach for naming our classes, and using the BEM principles with the Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS style guide (also called SMACSS).</p>
<p>By the end of this course, you&#8217;ll have a solid understanding of how to write scalable code that&#8217;s easier to use, understand, and maintain.</p>
