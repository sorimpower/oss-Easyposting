		<description><![CDATA[Tracy, that is great to hear. I agree that there are specific types of blogs that can get great advertising and do well--so that is heartening to hear.  How do you manage your ads? Do you sell them locally and work with an ad network for campaigns?

		<description><![CDATA[Depends on what they do.
Ads like those, or maybe Google AdSense (which we have never done - so much of it is ugly LOSE WEIGHT NOW!!!! clutter), may not be able to pay somebody&#039;s bills. But if you serve a niche that brings in thousands daily and you sell targeted advertising - like in our case, local display advertising, but doesn&#039;t have to be geographic if you are serving a content niche that works well with a certain category of ad - you CAN make a living - we are, and we are no whizkids.
