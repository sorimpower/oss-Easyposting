				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most people are familiar with the Gartner Hype Cycle. It is a great framework for looking at the development of important technological innovations:</p>
<p><a href="http://avc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Hype-cycle.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12671" src="http://avc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Hype-cycle-600x413.jpg" alt="Hype-cycle" width="600" height="413" /></a></p>
<p>It is interesting to look at the price chart of Bitcoin in this context:</p>
<p><a href="http://avc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/btc-prices-since-jan-2012.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12672" src="http://avc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/btc-prices-since-jan-2012-600x364.jpg" alt="btc prices since jan 2012" width="600" height="364" /></a></p>
<p>It sure feels like we&#8217;ve been through the technology trigger phase, the inflated expectations phase, and are now well into the trough of disillusionment phase.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more interesting is the question of what will lead us onto the slope of enlightenment? I am thinking that we will start to see native applications of Bitcoin. These would be things that simply could not exist without this technology. Donating money to charity with Bitcoin is awesome, and I do it regularly, but it is not a native application of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>I plan to write more about these native applications because I think they are the key to getting to the next phase in the Bitcoin adoption cycle.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As my extended vacation comes to an end, the question of how I was going to blog during it also comes to an end. For the most part it was the same as usual. There were a few reblogs on the days I didn&#8217;t want to blog. And some vacation oriented posts. The photoblogging experiment was largely a failure but I am going to give it one more shot before the vacation is over.</p>
<p>I saw this painting today at the <a href="http://www.mam.paris.fr/">Paris Museum Of Modern Art</a>. It was painted by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Delaunay">Robert Delaunay</a> in 1926. It is called Tour Eiffel. I really like it and thought I would share it with all of you. I hope you like it as much as I do.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are two guest posts that are essentially tied for the most popular guest post ever on AVC. They are both in the top ten of all posts on AVC since I put Google Analytics on this blog at the start of 2007. They each have seen about 125,000 page views since they were published.</p>
<p>The first is <a href="https://twitter.com/spolsky">Joel Spolsky</a>&#8216;s guest post on <a href="http://avc.com/2012/02/the-management-team-guest-post-from-joel-spolsky/">The Management Team</a>.</p>
<p>The second is this post below from <a href="https://twitter.com/FAKEGRIMLOCK">Fake Grimlock</a>.</p>
<p>Both are great, but I felt like putting some dino magic on the blog today.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>MINIMUM VIABLE PERSONALITY</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">MOST IMPORTANT STEP FOR BUILD PRODUCT IS BUILD PRODUCT.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">SECOND MOST IMPORTANT IS BUILD PERSONALITY FOR PRODUCT.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">NO HAVE PERSONALITY? PRODUCT BORING, NO ONE WANT.</span></p>
<p><a style="display: inline;" href="http://avc.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/6a00d83451b2c969e2015391f27bab970b.jpg"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451b2c969e2015391f27bab970b" title="BREADORBACON" src="http://avc.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/6a00d83451b2c969e2015391f27bab970b-500wi.jpg" alt="BREADORBACON" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>PERSONALITY BETTER THAN MARKETING</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">WHEN CHOOSE PRODUCT, HUMANS ONLY CARE ABOUT DOES WORK, AND IS INTERESTING.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">WORLD ALREADY FULL OF THINGS DO WORK. MOST BORING.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">PERSONALITY = INTERESTING. INTERESTING = CARE. CARE = TALK. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">EVERYONE CARE AND TALK ABOUT PRODUCT? YOU WIN.</span></p>
<p><a style="display: inline;" href="http://avc.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/6a00d83451b2c969e2015435c5e878970c.jpg"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451b2c969e2015435c5e878970c" title="CAREPLUSTALKISWIN" src="http://avc.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/6a00d83451b2c969e2015435c5e878970c-500wi.jpg" alt="CAREPLUSTALKISWIN" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>SELL TO FRIENDS, NOT STRANGERS</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">PERSONALITY MAKE PRODUCT FRIEND. YOU HELP FRIEND. YOU FORGIVE WHEN FRIEND NOT PERFECT. YOU WANT FRIEND WIN.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">BORING STRANGER?… YOU NOT.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">PERSONALITY IS API FOR LOYALTY. NO ONE CARE WHICH BORING STRANGER IS NEXT. BUT ALWAYS WANT FRIEND NEXT. </span></p>
<p><a style="display: inline;" href="http://avc.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/6a00d83451b2c969e2015391f27b0d970b.jpg"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451b2c969e2015391f27b0d970b" title="LOYALTYPORT" src="http://avc.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/6a00d83451b2c969e2015391f27b0d970b-500wi.jpg" alt="LOYALTYPORT" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>PERSONALITY MAKE MEANING</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">CAN PET ROCK. PET DOG BETTER. PET DOG HAVE MEANING.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">BORING PRODUCT IS ROCK. NO HAVE MEANING. INTERACT WITH PERSONALITY DIFFERENT. HAVE MEANING.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">INTERESTING PRODUCT THAT GIVE FRIENDS MEANING = MOST WIN OF ALL.</span></p>
<p><a style="display: inline;" href="http://avc.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/6a00d83451b2c969e2015435c5ea4a970c.jpg"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451b2c969e2015435c5ea4a970c" title="NOTAROCK" src="http://avc.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/6a00d83451b2c969e2015435c5ea4a970c-500wi.jpg" alt="NOTAROCK" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>HOW NOT BE BORING</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">HAVE PERSONALITY EASY. ANSWER THREE QUESTIONS:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">1. HOW YOU CHANGE CUSTOMER&#8217;S LIFE? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">2. WHAT YOU STAND FOR?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">3. WHO OR WHAT YOU HATE?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">NOW HAVE MISSION, VALUES, ENEMY. THAT ENOUGH FOR MINIMUM VIABLE PERSONALITY.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">KEEP IN BRAIN WHEN WRITE, TALK, BLOG, TWEET. ITERATE. IMPROVE WHAT WORK. DELETE WHAT NOT. PERSONALITY GROW.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>NO BE CHICKEN</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">CHICKEN LIVE IN CAGE. NO CAN HAVE PERSONALITY INSIDE CAGE. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">LAST STEP IS SMASH CAGE, LIGHT BARN ON FIRE.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">DO THAT, YOU WIN.</span></p>
<p><a style="display: inline;" href="http://avc.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/6a00d83451b2c969e2015391f27a24970b.jpg"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451b2c969e2015391f27a24970b" title="CHICKENWIN" src="http://avc.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/6a00d83451b2c969e2015391f27a24970b-500wi.jpg" alt="CHICKENWIN" /></a></p>

<p>here’s the current state of my phone’s home screen.</p>
<p>adds:</p>
<p>&#8211; snapchat &#8211; which along with Kik is how i stay in touch with my son Josh at college</p>
<p>&#8211; audible &#8211; which we are using to listen to audiobooks on our trip. i think we will continue to use audible on our drives back and forth to our house in long island so it’s now on the home screen</p>
<p>&#8211; wordpress &#8211; because i’ve been blogging on my phone a lot on this trip. i think i will continue to do that when we get back. it’s awesome.</p>
<p>to make room for all of these adds I took off the search bar. i find myself just going to Chrome to search anyway and i wasn’t using it</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We were driving up the coast of Italy from Rome to Genoa listening to music being bluetoothed from my phone to the car&#8217;s audio system and the Gotham Gal said, &#8220;let&#8217;s listen to some audio books on this trip.&#8221; I was dubious but she was adamant. &#8220;I tried it on a drive from NYC to Long Island this summer and it is really great&#8221;, she said. So I replied &#8220;sure.&#8221; Later that night in our hotel, using their wifi, I downloaded <a href="http://www.audible.com/mt/Apps/">the Audible app</a> and a few books onto my phone.</p>
<p>We started with <a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Bios-Memoirs/A-Year-in-Provence-Audiobook/B002V0QRX6/">Peter Mayle&#8217;s A Year In Provence</a>. That was awesome. Listening to a book about a place like Provence while driving around Provence is a fantastic experience. That sold me hook line and sinker on this audio book in the car thing.</p>
<p>Then we went for <a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/History/The-Boys-in-the-Boat-Audiobook/B00D3PBYAE/">Daniel James Brown&#8217;s The Boys In The Boat</a>. We failed to check how long the audio book was before selecting it. This particular audio book is 14 hours 25 minutes. Good thing we were taken with the story. We stuck it out and finished it yesterday. We cheered as the author ended the story. That was a marathon. All that said, it is a great story about the boys from the University of Washington who won the Olympic Gold Medal in the Berlin Olympics of 1936 in the eight category.</p>
<p>The strange thing about audio books is the play time of the book and the page length of the book are not directly correlated. Boys In The Boat took 14 hours 25 minutes to listen to and it is 416 pages. A Year In Provence took 2 hours and 52 minutes to listen to and the book is 224 pages. I think it may have to do with the fact that the audio book version of A Year In Provence we listened to is abridged.</p>
<p>In any case, we found that three hours is a great length for an audio book. Fourteen and a half hours felt a bit long, maybe even more than a bit long.</p>
<p>We are now listening to <a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Classics/The-Sun-Also-Rises-Audiobook/B002V8HIQ8/">Hemingway&#8217;s The Sun Also Rises</a>. Given that we are now in Paris having recently been in Barcelona, Pamplona, and San Sebastian, it seemed like the right time to revisit that novel.</p>
<p>The Gotham Gal&#8217;s pitch on audio books is that it makes long drives fly by. I am not sure they &#8220;fly by&#8221;, but I would agree that listening to a great narrator read an interesting story does make long drives a lot more enjoyable.</p>
<p>It looks like we&#8217;ve got a new pastime. And I&#8217;m happy about that.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We visited the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao earlier this week. They were exhibiting a video installation called The Visitors by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragnar_Kjartansson_(performance_artist)">Ragnar Kjartansson</a>. It&#8217;s not easily captured in a YouTube video, but that&#8217;s the best I can do for all of you. Basically you walk into a big room and on every wall there is a video playing of a musician and each is playing a part in the song. You walk around and you hear the various musicians playing. It&#8217;s awesome. I loved it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have found that the best way to deal with policy makers and regulators when something new and threatening and dangerous looking comes around is to educate, educate, educate, educate. You can hire expensive lobbyists, you can try the &#8220;ignore and deal with it later&#8221; approach, and you can try operating in other more welcoming locations. But in our view the best approach is to take the time and effort to explain things, listen to the concerns, get the best and brightest minds involved to work things out together and come to the right answers.</p>
<p>It is in this spirit that a new organization called the <a href="http://coincenter.org/">Coin Center</a> has launched. The Coin Center will be led by <a href="https://twitter.com/jerrybrito">Jerry Brito</a> who has done some of the best Bitcoin education and advocacy work in his former role at George Mason University&#8217;s Mercatus Center. So Jerry really won&#8217;t be doing anything new here. But he will be able to focus 100% of his time on this work and will have more financial and organization support to do it.</p>
<p>The Washington Post has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/09/18/bitcoin-gets-an-industry-backed-advocacy-group/">a good article explaining the Coin Center and who is initially behind it.</a></p>
<p>I would like to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/morcosa">Alex Morcos</a> of Chaincode Labs and <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis">Balaji Srinivasan</a> of Andreessen Horowitz for all the hard work they did bringing the Coin Center to life. Without their persistence, I don&#8217;t think this would have happened.</p>
<p>USV is proud to be a financial supporter of the Coin Center along with a handful of the most active entrepreneurs and investors in the blockchain sector. We will be reaching out broadly to everyone who has an interest in this sector in the coming months to get involved in some way. Technologies such as cryptocurrencies, bitcoin, and the blockchain are important, fundamental, and will foster innovation for decades to come. We must make sure that policy makers and regulators are well educated and informed so that they will put forward policies that will accelerate the development of these technologies, not retard them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in 2008 and 2009, probably because of our investment in Twitter, I was obsessed with looking at acquisition traffic from search and social and comparing the two. Here&#8217;s an example of <a href="http://avc.com/2009/04/the-power-of-passed-links/">a post I wrote at that time</a> looking at the two channels and comparing them.</p>
<p>At some point, I became convinced that websites would eventually see more acquisition traffic coming from social than they were seeing from search, which was the king dog of Internet traffic at the time. It was a hotly debated issue but, again maybe because of how long we were on Twitter, I was convinced social would be king some day.</p>
<p>I stopped obsessing about that issue sometime around 2010 and moved on to mobile as the thing I thought about and wrote about the most.</p>
<p>But today, when I was looking to see if the traffic to AVC had declined a lot while I have been away and blogging about all sorts of non work stuff (it hasn&#8217;t), I saw this chart of year to date acquisition traffic to AVC.</p>
<p><a href="http://avc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/acquisition-channels.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12637" src="http://avc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/acquisition-channels-600x260.jpg" alt="acquisition channels" width="600" height="260" /></a></p>
<p>Social, and for AVC that means Twitter and Disqus, brings 23% of the visits to AVC. Search brings less than 20%. And it&#8217;s been that way for a long time now. Well over three years.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s kind of funny to think that we wondered and debated about such things back in 2008 and 2009. It&#8217;s not a debate any more and its not something to wonder about. It&#8217;s reality now.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our portfolio company <a href="https://coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a> announced something yesterday that went largely unnoticed, but might be one of the most important things to happen in the Bitcoin space in a while.</p>
<p>They put out a bunch of developer tools under the name <a href="http://blog.coinbase.com/post/97671295752/introducing-toshi-an-open-source-bitcoin-node-for">Toshi</a>, including a full open source version of their Bitcoin node. When you combine Toshi with the core Bitcoin APIs it comes with and the Coinbase APIs, you get a platform for building Bitcoin applications that is unmatched in the market.</p>
<p>The reality is building on top of the Bitcoin Core is not a simple task. There is a lot you need to do to make it work. Coinbase has been building on top of the Bitcoin Core for over two years and has addressed many (most?) of the obvious needs and they are now making all of that technology available to developers who want to build Bitcoin applications but don&#8217;t want to get knee deep in the Bitcoin Core.</p>
<p>There is <a href="https://bitcoin.toshi.io/">a free hosted version of Toshi</a>, you can download and run Toshi on your own servers, or you deploy Toshi to Heroku with just one click.</p>
<p>If you are building Bitcoin applications or thinking about it, check out <a href="http://blog.coinbase.com/post/97671295752/introducing-toshi-an-open-source-bitcoin-node-for">Toshi</a>. I think making Bitcoin easier for developers is a big thing and I&#8217;m pleased to see Coinbase doing exactly that.</p>
