				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Premium pricing for premium value has made native advertising the great hope for publishers desperate to escape the death spiral of plunging CPM prices for display advertising.  For newspapers, premium pricing for premium value is why print advertising cash flow is still keeping their businesses afloat.</p>
<p>Native advertising could be the long hoped for bridge to a digital future for newspapers, to finally achieve the kind of premium pricing for digital advertising that they have in print, and to effectively monetizing the rapid rise of mobile news consumption.  But near-term, the opportunity for newspapers with native advertising is not just digital.</p>
<p>Newspapers should sell native advertising in print.</p>
<p>Magazines have been running “advertorials” for years, i.e. native advertising in print is not a new idea.  Forbes, for example, wisely extends its <a href="http://www.forbesmedia.com/print-brandvoice/">BrandVoice native advertising program into print</a>:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2180" title="forbes_brandvoice_print" src="http://blog.publish2.com/images/2013/06/forbes_brandvoice_print.png" alt="" width="480" height="315" /></p>
<p>Forbes is very smart to position the value of native advertising in print as a complement to the value in digital:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2181" title="forbes_brandvoice" src="http://blog.publish2.com/images/2013/06/forbes_brandvoice.png" alt="" width="480" height="190" /></p>
<p>Newspapers can and should do the same.  And some already are. The New York Post ran this ad for their new native advertising program&#8230; in the print newspaper:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2184" title="nypost_nativeads" src="http://blog.publish2.com/images/2013/06/nypost_nativeads.png" alt="" width="360" height="480" /></p>
<p>There is clearly demand for businesses to have a “voice,” to be part of the conversation with consumers, beyond the pure marketing of display ads.  Newspaper brands are still an extremely high value, trusted context for making your voice heard.</p>
<p>For businesses, reversing the old adage, 1,000 words printed in a newspaper are actually worth far more than a 300&#215;250 picture on the web.  For local businesses in particular, having a substantive voice in the affairs of their community has huge value.  It’s a way to brand themselves as an integral part of the community, and worthy of local consumers’ business.</p>
<p>With their new focus on marketing services, newspapers could for example help local business leaders start blogs, with that content appearing as native ads in print and in the newspaper’s digital products.  In fact, for newspapers that help brands create content, distributing that content in print and the newspaper’s website would be a powerful complement to the social and search distribution that the newspapers&#8217; marketing services have been selling.</p>
<p>Just as many publishers are still using display ads to complement native ads in digital, newspapers could run native ads for local businesses alongside their display ads &#8212; so <strong><em>no cannibalization</em></strong>. Cannibalizing print ad dollars is the great fear of every newspaper sales team, and such fear is how they have managed in many cases to thwart the development of new digital ad models.</p>
<p>But with native ads, the print sales team can not only protect but actually <strong><em>grow</em></strong> their key accounts.  It’s the alignment of interests that every newspaper publisher has been struggling with in the business model transition.</p>
<p>Will native ads in print break the church/state barrier and destroy the newspaper’s credibility? Not if it’s done right.  It’s all about transparency. The key is readers need to know the content is paid for.  Keep in mind that display ads in print are not typically labeled as ads &#8212; even when they started appearing on the once sacrosanct front page.  Traditional display ads in print work because consumers have learned over time how to recognize them as ads.  With ads as content in print, consumers can also learn, with the right labeling and design framework, to distinguish pay-for-play content from editorial content.</p>
<p>The Washington Post recently launched <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/sponsored-views">Sponsored Views</a>, which lets businesses and advocacy organizations pay to have their comments appear at the top of the Post’s comments section.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2185" title="washingtonpost_sponsorviews" src="http://blog.publish2.com/images/2013/06/washingtonpost_sponsorviews.png" alt="" width="480" height="405" /></p>
<p>It’s a not big leap from there to giving businesses a voice in print with native ads.</p>
<p>Native ads in print could also revitalize the appeal of newspapers to national advertisers, by providing a seamless extension for the digital distribution of branded content into print.  For a native ad network, extending the value into print could be a significant near-term arbitrage opportunity, and a key competitive advantage (albeit counterintuitive).</p>
<p>With a <a href="https://www.publish2.com/#native_advertising">native ad platform that supports both digital and print distribution</a>, newspapers can scale native ads across all their products, with the sales team fully aligned on the value for key accounts.  With a native ad platform that supports both local sales and a national network, newspapers can maximize the near-term cash flow from print and have a much greater chance of succeeding with the longer-term transition to digital.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When a term is as hot and hyped as &#8220;native advertising&#8221;, it&#8217;s inevitable that everyone will want to appropriate it to describe everything they are doing. Which means the term will be widely misappropriated.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s still open for debate exactly what native advertising is, it&#8217;s useful to agree on what native advertising is NOT. Here are 5 types of advertising that are not *native* advertising:</p>
<p><strong>1. Advertiser content that’s a poor fit with a publisher&#8217;s brand</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“15 Crazy Dance Crazes” on a financial news and commentary site</li>
<li>“Men Only: The Case Against Exercising” and “2 Metabolism-Destroying Foods to Avoid at All Costs” on a high-end real estate site</li>
<li>“Rare plant may increase muscle growth 700% &#8212; but is it an unfair advantage?” on a state capital news site</li>
</ul>
<p>If it makes the editorial staff cringe or quake, it’s NOT native advertising.</p>
<p>The problem for the publisher’s brand is an issue of both relevance and content quality.  Many publishers have tolerated low quality content that&#8217;s a poor brand fit when it was just links on their site.  But when the content actually *appears* on their site, the potential for brand damage and alienating readers is much greater.</p>
<p>Ensuring the brand fit that makes the advertising native can&#8217;t be managed by an algorithm, it requires editorial judgment.</p>
<p><strong>2. Link to advertiser&#8217;s site that takes you off the publisher&#8217;s site</strong></p>
<p>If you leave the publisher&#8217;s site to engage with the content on the advertiser’s site, you&#8217;re off the reservation.  Literally.  The key to *native* advertising is the value of the publisher&#8217;s BRAND, and the value to the advertiser’s brand of appearing in the *context* where the publisher’s editorial content appears.</p>
<p>The value of the publisher&#8217;s brand and the editorial context is lost if you leave the publisher&#8217;s site.</p>
<p>Brands understandably want to build their own destination sites, and there are plenty of effective ways to buy traffic with links. But that’s NOT native advertising.</p>
<p><strong>3. Advertiser content that isn’t in the publisher’s CMS</strong></p>
<p>Delivering native ad content with javascript onto a publisher’s site, like a display ad, is likely to be the simplest option for many publishers.  But if the content only appears to be on the publisher’s site, then it’s not really native. It may fool consumers, and that may be sufficient in many cases.</p>
<p>But there’s a reason why publishers like BuzzFeed and Forbes, who are leading the charge on native advertising, have given advertisers direct access to their CMS on the backend. These publishers want to give advertisers access to the same content tools used by their editorial staff.</p>
<p>Only by publishing the content IN the publisher’s CMS, just like the editorial content, can ad content be truly native. Native advertising doesn&#8217;t need to simulate the publisher&#8217;s template and styling if it&#8217;s in the publisher&#8217;s CMS alongside the editorial content.</p>
<p>For a native advertising platform, the ideal integration with a publisher’s site, where possible, is on the backend, directly into the CMS. The larger, more sophisticated publishers, and advertisers, will ultimately demand this approach.</p>
<p><strong>4. Fixed position above or below the content stream</strong></p>
<p>Native advertising headlines need to appear dynamically WITHIN the editorial content stream.  That&#8217;s what makes, for example, Twitter’s Promoted Tweets so native &#8212; they are IN the stream.</p>
<p>A fixed position above or below the content stream is just a display ad position that happens to have content in it (which has been around for a long time). It may be advertiser content, but it’s not *native* advertising.</p>
<p><strong>5.  Advertiser content that’s not in a feed</strong></p>
<p>When publishers and editors talk about the flow of editorial content, they talk about FEEDS.  Feeds are fundamental to news, and they are fundamental to mobile, where the optimal user experience for content is a feed, i.e. a stream.</p>
<p>If advertiser content must be added to a native ad platform as separate, disconnected items, then it’s not a FEED , and therefore it’s not managed in the same way as the editorial content. If  advertiser content is not in a feed, then it&#8217;s not a continuous flow of value, like a publisher delivers &#8212; it&#8217;s just a one-off ad, like a display ad.</p>
<p>Native advertising isn&#8217;t flighted, it flows continuously. It&#8217;s iterative. It tells a story over time.</p>
<p>Truly native advertising requires “feed management”, whereby feeds of advertiser content are integrated with feeds of editorial content to create a seamless user experience.  That&#8217;s how brands can achieve the continuous engagement that they want from native advertising.</p>
<p>For brands to truly go native, and for <a href="http://blog.publish2.com/2013/05/30/scaling-native-advertising/">native advertising to scale</a>, advertisers must manage and distribute their content via feeds, just like publishers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How will native advertising scale?</p>
<p>That’s the question on the mind of every brand advertiser, ad agency, and publisher.</p>
<p>Native advertising has emerged as a great hope for the future of advertising, to capture the billions of brand ad dollars expected to shift from TV, where mass audiences are finally collapsing, and from online display advertising, where already rock bottom prices, consumer attention, and effectiveness continue to plummet.  Native advertising is also a great hope for monetizing mobile, where display ads aren’t just dying but DOA and digital dimes have turned into pennies at best.</p>
<p>The hope for native advertising is based on its potential to create immense value for everyone involved:</p>
<p><strong>Value for Consumers</strong></p>
<p>At its best, native advertising gives consumers content that is genuinely interesting, engaging, and useful.  As BuzzFeed has pioneered, the best native ad content can be so engaging that consumers share it with their friends.</p>
<p>Native advertising is a stark contrast to the interruptive advertising model and to display ads that are so uninteresting, useless, and value destroying that “banner blindness” is now universal.</p>
<p>Native advertising truly is NATIVE when consumers can value the content the same way they value editorial content.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Value for Brands</strong></p>
<p>Brands buy display ads because they know they have to follow consumers online, but they have always been skeptical of the value for branding (e.g. advertiser obsession with clicks when the campaign goal is supposed to be branding).</p>
<p>Brands want to be the center of attention, to command consumer engagement. Brands don’t want to be stuck in the sidebar.  And even when the display ad takes over the page, smart brands know that this kind of hostile action doesn’t create positive brand associations.</p>
<p>Pissing off consumers is not how you build brands.</p>
<p>Native advertising enables brands to effectively leverage the consumer attention that publishers still command, with content that can engage those consumers as much as (or, holy grail, even more than) the publisher’s own editorial content.  That’s the kind of value-creating engagement that builds brands.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Value for Publishers</strong></p>
<p>Native advertising gives publishers a golden opportunity to correct the true “original sin” of online publishing &#8212; display advertising.</p>
<p>Native advertising has such huge potential for publishers precisely because, unlike display advertising, it can create real value for consumers and advertisers.  When value is aligned for consumers and advertisers, publishers win.</p>
<p>But native advertising can also enable publishers to overcome the most destructive aspect of online display advertising, which is that display ad networks can target a publisher’s premium audience via cookies when that audience goes elsewhere (i.e. when they visit less expensive sites).  <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/02/im-being-followed-how-google-151-and-104-other-companies-151-are-tracking-me-on-the-web/253758/">The Atlantic’s Alexis Madrigal explored this problem</a> in great depth, and sums it up like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Now you can buy the audience without the publication.”</p></blockquote>
<p>With native advertising, the value shifts back to the *publication* itself, to the premium native *context* that publishers create and which can’t be reproduced and sold at lower cost elsewhere.  Native ad content can only be *native* to a publication, and get the lift from the publisher’s brand, on the publisher’s own site.</p>
<p>Native advertising could also solve the huge problem publishers have with mobile, which is that they would go out of business tomorrow if their audience went 100% mobile, due to the abjectly poor monetization.  Twitter’s native ad format, Promoted Tweets, has shown <a href="http://wallblog.co.uk/2012/09/27/promoted-tweets-on-mobile-are-achieving-more-than-40-in-terms-of-engagement/">exceptional performance in mobile</a>. Native ads in mobile could be the perfect alignment of value for consumers, brands, and publisher.</p>
<p>For newspapers, there’s an additional opportunity &#8212; run native ads in print. Magazines have been doing it for years with advertorials and have made it kosher with proper labeling. Newspapers can’t afford to overlook an opportunity to generate more revenue from print, given the fixed cost, if it can be done in a way that creates real value for consumers.</p>
<p>So much potential, and yet&#8230;</p>
<p>To be valuable to brand advertisers, native advertising must SCALE.  Brand advertising needs *reach*, and without scale, there’s no reach.</p>
<p>Native advertising faces two huge barriers to scale:</p>
<p><strong>1. Scaling Content Creation</strong></p>
<p>Madison Avenue is structured to produce “creative”, not content in the editorial sense, which is required for native advertising to be effective.</p>
<p>BuzzFeed is at the forefront of creating a scalable model for native ad content creation. They aren’t just creating content for brands that is similar to their editorial content &#8212; it’s literally the same.  That’s what makes it truly NATIVE.</p>
<p>The BuzzFeed team that creates native ad content for advertisers is not some watered down version of the editorial team appended to some marketing department.  It’s fully equivalent.  They create content that is indistinguishable from BuzzFeed’s editorial content in terms of quality, consumer engagement and social distribution.  It just happens to be paid for by a brand.</p>
<p>BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Paretti is the <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/01/04/buzzfeeds-business-model-scale-is-a-problem-and-thats-a-good-thing/">first to admit</a> that creating great content that will actually engage consumers does not scale in the traditional Silicon Valley sense.  But BuzzFeed is taking a fundamentally human process and optimizing it for scale. One key is <a href="http://adage.com/article/media/buzzfeed-starts-program-train-agencies/241395/">training agencies</a> to use BuzzFeed’s content creation platform, which could transform agencies into a scalable network of native ad content creators.</p>
<p><strong>Who Employs the Ad Content Creators?</strong></p>
<p>The irony is that the advantage in scaling native ad content creation will go to whoever employs the most journalists.   PR firms are very well positioned &#8212; they have been hiring journalists for years. They could pivot their niche digital content and microsite business into scalable content machines.</p>
<p>Of course, news organizations are arguably best positioned. Instead of laying off journalists and sending them to off to PR firms, they could re-employ them to create native ad content.  Dallas Morning News, for example, created <a href="http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/182689/#axzz2UJupuMrU">Speakeasy</a>, a joint venture with a local agency, that creates content for local businesses, which could be used to scale native advertising for local.  <a href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2013/04/native-advertising-shows-great-potential-but-blurs-editorial-lines092">Forbes hired a team </a>of writers and editors to help brands produce content for their BrandVoice native ad platform.</p>
<p>The advantage will likely go to whoever can combine the best content creators with the best content creation platform technology.</p>
<p><strong>2. Scaling Content Distribution</strong></p>
<p>The second barrier to native advertising scale is distribution &#8212; achieving the “reach” that  brand advertising demands.  No individual publisher will be able to deliver this kind of reach alone.  That&#8217;s why <a href="http://adage.com/article/digital/buzzfeed-building-a-native-advertising-network/240421/">BuzzFeed is building a native ad network</a>. It&#8217;s why Google launched AdSense once they perfected AdWords on their own property. Given the inherent fragmentation of the web, you need a network to scale distribution.</p>
<p>As Buzzfeed President Jon Steinberg explains it:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We always wanted the business not to be limited by the scale of our site,&#8221; Mr. Steinberg said. &#8220;That means figuring out places to what we do other than on Buzzfeed.com.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Algorithms are Too Risky</strong></p>
<p>Everyone is assuming that native advertising will scale distribution the same way that search and display advertising did &#8212; through algorithms and automation.  But native ads can’t scale that way because of the risk of damaging both the advertiser’s and publisher’s brand is so high.</p>
<p>The brank risk for advertisers can be overcome to some degree by giving them control over which publications their ads appear in.  Since a native ad is the primary content on a page, inappropriate content adjacency is not as significant a concern.  If brands have a feed of content (e.g. from a blog), they will also need to control what content is made available as a native ad, since all content in a given feed might not be appropriate.</p>
<p>The brand risk for publishers, however, is much more difficult to overcome.  After the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2013/01/15/the-atlantics-scientology-problem-start-to-finish/">Scientology debacle</a>, which has become a cautionary tale for the risk that native advertising poses to publishers, The Atlantic said that “native ads will go through a two-part review.” This was a rational response, given the need to protect their high value brand.</p>
<p>But such a review process is a huge barrier to scale.</p>
<p><strong>Existing Display Ad Tech Won’t Work</strong></p>
<p>And that’s why existing ad tech won’t work for native advertising.  Ad tech designed to scale based on semantic targeting and automated placements would create huge brand risk.  There’s a lot more at risk when a poorly targeted ad appears in the main content stream than when it appears off to the side where consumers ignore it anyway.</p>
<p>For example, a Pepsi-sponsored video of Beyonce’s new dance routine, while high quality and valuable content, is not a brand fit with BoingBoing.  Cleaning tips from Cottonelle is not a brand fit with a business news site.</p>
<p>What makes ad content “native” is much more than just making it appear like editorial content on a site &#8212; that’s just a superficial styling trick, which is commodity technology.  What makes the ad native is how well the topic, voice, and substance fit with the publisher’s brand, so that it flows with the editorial content, not sticks out like a sore thumb.  To achieve that kind of brand fit and relevancy requires human editorial judgment.</p>
<p><strong>Native Ad Platform Must Scale Editorial Judgement</strong></p>
<p>To scale distribution, native advertising needs an ad platform that can scale human editorial judgement and provide an efficient interface for publishers and brands to control the flow of native ad content.</p>
<p>Brands need to be able to choose the publications and curate content best suited to appear natively on those sites.</p>
<p>Publishers, then, need to be able to curate the native ad content available from those advertisers. Publishers need to apply editorial standards, which only human judgment can do, and optimize content selection for relevance and brand fit.  A native ad platform needs to enable publishers and editors to do what they do best &#8212; create the best content package for consumers.</p>
<p>That’s the kind of deep content integration, beyond superficial styling, that native advertising needs to succeed and create real value at scale, and an algorithm can’t do it. But technology-enabled editors can do it, at scale.</p>
<p>A native ad platform could achieve even greater scale through network effects, by sharing editorial judgment across the network.  Brands should be able to see which publishers and editors are publishing their content, and publishers should be able to share judgments about which native ad content is highest quality and most trustworthy.   Platforms ranging from Digg to Twitter have shown that network effects are the key to scaling editorial judgment.</p>
<p>Google’s AdWords/AdSense brilliantly combined relevancy, as determined principally by an ad’s clickthrough rate, with the cost-per-click bid.  A native ad platform needs to similarly combine  human quality judgment with a cost bid to create a liquid marketplace.</p>
<p><strong>Native Ad Platform Must Be a CONTENT Platform</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, a scalable native ad platform needs to be designed to handle content.  Native ad content needs to be optimized so that it appears native in each publication, to give advertiser the full brand lift of the publication’s brand.</p>
<p>A truly native advertising network can’t be a “link economy,” it needs to optimize the user experience by publishing the brand’s content directly into the publication, natively, right alongside the publication’s editorial content. Especially in mobile, it’s a essential to create a continuous content experience that seamlessly combines editorial and native ad content, without bouncing users out of the app or responsive site. Quartz has done a great job creating that kind of optimized mobile experience for native ads. On the other end of the platform spectrum, imagine flowing native ad content into a print editorial system.</p>
<p>But all that heavy duty content optimization and integrated publishing is not what display ad tech was designed to do. A platform for native advertising must be, at its core, a content platform.</p>
<p><strong>AdWords + AdSense Equivalent for Native Ads</strong></p>
<p>It’s instructive to remember that Google actually copied the pay-per-click search advertising model from Overture, but Google ultimately won because they first achieved scale for AdWords on their own search property. This gave them a pivotal advantage over Overture’s pure ad network model, because Google grew a much larger base of advertisers and ads via AdWords, which they were able to scale across the AdSense network.</p>
<p>Publishers like BuzzFeed, Forbes, Quartz, and Yahoo have the advantage of using their own sites to perfect their content creation platforms for native advertising.  Whoever perfects that native advertising equivalent of AdWords will then need the platform equivalent of <a href="http://googlepress.blogspot.com/2004/04/google-acquires-applied-semantics.html">Applied Semantics</a>, the company Google acquired to create AdSense.  The Applied Semantics of native advertising will be the platform that makes editorial judgment scalable for distribution.</p>
<p>Success in native advertising will be about technology-enabling human editorial work, on both the supply side and the demand side, at network scale.</p>
<p>The allocation of ad budgets to native advertising will likely be dramatic and disruptive. The question is, when the money flows, which content creation and distribution platforms for native advertising can scale to capture those dollars?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Five years ago, I wrote a post about <a href="../2006/01/21/how-to-fix-rss/">How to Fix RSS</a> (which was my first post to appear at the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.techmeme.com/060121/p21">top of Techmeme</a>). The technology and media landscape has dramatically changed since then, so I’ve updated the simple three-step program, with a particular focus on news organizations.</p>
<p>RSS is NOT <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=rss+is+dead&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">dead</a>&#8230; it just needs to be reborn:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take down the partial text RSS feeds from your website &#8212; they are  useless, and nobody uses them.  (Refer the four people still using them  to 2 or 3 below.)</li>
<li>Post your best content to Twitter and Facebook &#8212; they are infinitely more user-friendly, mainstream, and <strong>social</strong> than RSS readers, making them infinitely more useful and valuable.  And  keep that old, reliable email newsletter&#8230; email will outlive us all.</li>
<li>Create full text RSS feeds for B2B syndication and partnerships  (content sharing, new platform like Flipborad, Ongo, Zite etc.).  Rather  than hand everyone raw RSS feeds, distribute them through a platform that can provide:
<ul>
<li>Tracking and metrics</li>
<li>Control over distribution to partners</li>
<li>Control over terms of use</li>
<li>Support for web syndication (e.g. automate hard-coded links back, add <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.google.com/support/news_pub/bin/answer.py?answer=191283">Google syndication-source meta tag</a>)</li>
<li>Support for all of your business models (without co-opting them)</li>

<p>Lastly, here’s a still relevant (dare I say <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.steverubel.com/as-screens-and-curators-proliferate-media-bra">prescient</a>) excerpt from my original post:</p>

<blockquote><p>Many  people have reached  out to us recently and asked, &#8220;How&#8217;s  Publish2  doing? You guys have  been very quiet for the last few months.&#8221;  That’s  because we’ve had our  heads down rolling out the full content   distribution service that we <a href="http://blog.publish2.com/2010/05/24/publish2-news-exchange-the-next-evolution-of-the-newswire/">announced last summer</a> and launched in beta last fall. And&#8230; we’ve successfully launched our business model.</p>
<p>So   it’s time for an update on the growth of our content distribution    network and our new software-as-a-service licensing business.</p>
<h3>Network Growth</h3>
<p>The   value of any network grows exponentially with the number of    participants. So we’re excited to report the our network now includes    over 200 news organizations that are actively distributing and acquiring    content through Publish2.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.publish2.com/about/network">See who’s in the Publish2 network.</a></p>
<p>We’ve   found the key to network growth is members “inviting their  friends,”   just like on Facebook, which in our case means news  organizations   inviting their partners. When all of your partners, and  news orgs that   you want to partner with, are on the network, it’s easy  to see the  value  in joining.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Originally published on <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2010/12/scott-karp-clay-shirkys-right-that-syndications-getting-disrupted-%E2%80%94-but-not-in-the-ways-he-thinks-it-is/">Nieman Journalism Lab</a></em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2010/12/what-will-2011-bring-for-journalism-clay-shirky-predicts-widespread-disruptions-for-syndication/">Clay Shirky predicts</a> that in 2011 traditional news syndication will see widespread disruption. I couldn’t agree more. But I don’t think the disruption will happen the way Clay describes it.</p>
<p>Clay’s prediction assumes that news consumption will continue its shift from traditional media to the traditional desktop web, where the hyperlink rules and news consumers bounce from hyperlinked page to hyperlinked page and from site to site to site. I think that assumption is wrong. In 2011, we’ll see open acknowledgement of what has long been understood about the traditional desktop web as a platform for consuming news content — it sucks.</p>
<p>The desktop web has been a revolutionary platform in terms of access to information, the democratization of publishing, and the socialization of media. But as a medium for consuming news content, from a user interface and user experience perspective, it’s problematic at best and downright awful at worst. News consumption has begun a major shift from the traditional desktop web to apps for touch tablets for a simple reason — the user experience and user interface are so much better, as the <a href="http://www.rjionline.org/digital-publishing/dpa/stories/research-projects/ipad-news-survey">recent RJI survey of iPad users</a> reflects. Consumers are choosing tablet apps over the traditional desktop web based on the quality of the user experience and the overall content “package.”</p>
<p>News organizations are already shifting their strategies to take advantage of that consumer shift. But few have thought about the role of syndication in news apps. With the immersive, hands-on experience of a tablet news app, the value of syndication changes entirely. Apps that deliver nothing but one news organization’s content will not compare favorably with the content richness of the web, no matter how good the UI is. And apps that bounce users around from site to site with an in-app browser, mimicking the traditional desktop web model, will fail for precisely the reason why users chose the app in the first place.</p>
<p>But news apps that can deliver full content, curated from a wide range of sources, within a cohesive, optimized — even breakthrough — UI for news consumption, will win because users will have the best of both worlds. Syndication in news apps will not be about republishing news that everyone else has. It will be about combining curated news with original content in order to create consumer packages that are deeply engaging and in many cases worth paying for. With this shift, news organizations will stop ceding to aggregators the huge value creation of curating and packaging news. Instead, news organizations will start defining their editorial brands as curators as much as they define them as original content creators.<br />
<span id="more-1642"></span><br />
It’s important to note that this new paradigm for news consumption isn’t necessarily anti-web on the back end. It can work with an HTML5 site that creates the same immersive UX/UI as a platform-native app, and can be distributed with an app front end via app stores to support the news org’s business model. Web pages are also still necessary for links shared via social networks. But for a news consumer’s primary daily news consumption — for news orgs they have a direct relationship with — syndication that includes the full content in an immersive app experience will be an essential driver of success.</p>
<p>The other reality that Clay overlooks, on the other end of the news evolution, is that syndication for print newspapers still matters because the print product is generating the cash that’s funding the digital transformation. Reducing the cost of filling the news hole in print with disruptive syndication models will generate more cash for digital. In the near term, that will have a significant impact on how the business of syndication is reshaped.</p>
<p>In that context, here are four predictions for how traditional news syndication will be disrupted in 2011:</p>
<h2>Social network for news distribution</h2>
<p>Traditional syndication is based on a hub-and-spoke model, where a newswire middleman takes in content from many sources, combines it with original content, and redistributes it. This is an inefficient, obsolete model and will be replaced by a model that has proven wildly successful in the consumer world — the social network.</p>
<p>News organizations have already been <a href="http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=4685">forming direct distribution networks</a> to route around the traditional newswire middleman. In 2011, these networks will evolve beyond ad hoc email distribution to become truly scalable in a way that only a Facebook-like platform can enable. News organizations will create a network of trusted sources, the equivalent of “friends,” but where the relationships are based on distribution and the affiliation of editorial brands. I call this the “<a href="http://publishing2.com/2010/06/07/the-content-graph-and-the-future-of-brands/">Content Graph</a>,” the analogue to Facebook’s “Social Graph.”</p>
<p>The business of syndication and news distribution will be reshaped by the power of network effects. Why is that important? Watch <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/if-youre-in-the-internet-business-and-you-dont-watch-this-sean-parker-video-you-might-as-well-quit-right-now-2010-9">this Sean Parker talk</a>.</p>
<h2>Human editorial judgment redux</h2>
<p>Contrary to Clay’s devaluing of the wire editor’s judgment in selecting content, the value of human curation is actually becoming more important in defining the value of news brands. Google’s algorithm has dominated news distribution on the web (ask any news site what percentage of traffic comes from Google), but it’s being overtaken by social curation — links shared through social networks (ask any news site what percentage of traffic comes from Facebook and Twitter).</p>
<p>The same will happen with news organizations, as editors curate their Content Graph and create better editorial products than any algorithm can ever hope to create.</p>
<p>What social networks have proven is that people value most the judgment of other people they trust. You can trust a friend. You can trust the editor of your favorite news publication. But it’s about people. Syndication based on human curation will prove far more valuable to consumers than syndication based on faceless algorithms.</p>
<h2>Free content disrupts again, but differently</h2>
<p>The news industry has been disrupted by the explosion of content on the web and having to compete with free sources. A new model for syndication turns this disruption on its head by enabling news organizations to publish free content from high quality web publishers in exchange for branding and links back (a model that Yahoo, for example, has used for years).</p>
<p>News organizations can also barter content with partners to trade the value of content they have already paid to produce for content that they need. Syndication based on a barter economy will be extremely disruptive to traditional newswires charging for content.</p>
<p>Free syndicated content will also help the print product generate more cash in the near-term. (Never underestimate the importance of cash flow in business transformation.)</p>
<h2>News organizations take back control</h2>
<p>News organizations will increasingly take back control over how their own content is syndicated. This begins with taking back their rights from newswire middlemen, so they can have full control over the business strategy for their content syndication, whether they choose to barter, sell, or keep some content out of the syndication market entirely.</p>
<p>News organizations will also take control over how their content is packaged by aggregators, starting by taking control of their RSS feeds. The first big realization will be that RSS is dead as a consumer technology but has growing value as a B2B syndication mechanism. News organizations will start to take down the consumer feeds from their websites as they realize 99.9 percent of their audience who wants their “feed” is following them on Facebook or Twitter.</p>
<p>Instead of working ad hoc with aggregators and other partners, with no control over their B2B RSS feeds, news organizations will look for ways to more efficiently manage the commercial syndication of their content through a common platform that gives them both control and network scale.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">Yesterday, two stories from Aol&#8217;s <a title="DailyFinance" href="http://www.dailyfinance.com">DailyFinance</a> <a title="appeared in the Sunday print edition" href="http://blog.publish2.com/2010/06/07/publish2-news-exchange-stories-in-print-dailyfinance-in-the-daily-telegram/">appeared in the Sunday print edition</a> of the <a title="Daily Telegram" href="http://www.lenconnect.com/">Daily Telegram</a>, a newspaper in southern Michigan. These stories appeared on a business page that would otherwise have been produced almost entirely with stories from the Associated Press. The Daily Telegram got permission to publish these Aol stories not through a big corporate content deal, but directly through a peer-to-peer relationship &#8212; The Daily Telegram simply subscribed to DailyFinance&#8217;s newswire in <a id="kklg" title="Publish2's News Exchange." href="http://www.publish2.com/about/news-exchange/">Publish2&#8242;s News Exchange.</a></span></p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m going to tell you why what you see on this page of the Daily Telegram could play a decisive role in the race between Aol, Demand Media, and Yahoo to win the prize of big brand advertising on the web, and why it is also pivotal to the future of news.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s about a big idea that I introduced at <a id="odii" title="TechCrunch Disrupt" href="http://disrupt.techcrunch.com/s2010/">TechCrunch Disrupt</a>: <strong>The Content Graph</strong> &#8212; an analogue to the <a title="Social Graph" href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=383404517130">Social Graph</a>, where high quality content brands create a large scale distribution network that could rival search and social media as a distributor of content.</p>
<p>In the Social Graph, you&#8217;re defined by your friends. In the Content Graph, a content brand is defined by its distribution relationships with other content brands.</p>
<p>The Content Graph is about leveraging the brand equity and consumer trust that is the greatest asset of every traditional media company. It&#8217;s about building a content brand&#8217;s reputation through distribution.</p>
<p>The news industry&#8217;s business model broke after it lost control over the distribution of news, with news brands suffering one wave of disintermediation after another.</p>
<p>The Content Graph puts news brands back in the game, but not as a return to monolithic monopolies, rather through the power of <em>networks</em> &#8212; a network of content brands. (This network includes independent journalists who cultivate their own personal brands.)</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Content Graph could be a map for brand advertising on the web, that enables advertisers to tap into a network of high quality content brands, at scale.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1620" href="http://publishing2.com/2010/06/07/the-content-graph-and-the-future-of-brands/contentgraph_20100607/"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1620" title="contentgraph_20100607" src="http://publishing2.com/images/contentgraph_20100607-475x215.png" alt="" width="475" height="215" /></a></p>
<p>Sound interesting? Let&#8217;s dig deeper.<br />
<span id="more-1616"></span><br />
To understand the potential of the Content Graph, let&#8217;s look first at the race to become the most efficient, largest scale producer of high quality content in the world.</p>
<p>Demand Media has Aol and Yahoo in its sights to win this race. So <a title="declared Joanne Bradford" href="http://adage.com/digital/article?article_id=144279">declared Joanne Bradford</a>, the new chief revenue officer for Demand Media, and former head of U.S. ad sales for Yahoo, who knows as well as anyone why the race is on &#8212; Demand Media, Aol, and Yahoo are positioning themselves for the huge tide of big brand advertising that is expected to flood the web and digital media in the next 10 years. Bradford talks about advertisers like HP and General Mills appearing in &#8220;contextually relevant&#8221; pages of Demand Media content.</p>
<p>The first race for ad dollars on the web was won by search and its dominance of contextual relevance. But for the next wave of ad dollars, contextual relevance won&#8217;t be enough, because these are BRAND ad dollars, and big brands will seek out the most trusted, highest quality content brands.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Bradford states the goal of Demand Media like this: &#8220;We want to be the biggest, best destination for brands.&#8221;<br />
It&#8217;s about brands, and it&#8217;s about quality, as you&#8217;ll see in the first paragraph of <a title="Yahoo's announcement" href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Yahoo-to-Acquire-Associated-bw-3649978388.html?x=0&amp;.v=1">Yahoo&#8217;s announcement</a> of the Associated Content acquisition: &#8220;This strategic move extends Yahoo’s ability to provide <strong>high quality</strong>, personally relevant content for the benefit of more than 600 million users as well as tens of thousands of advertisers.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Aol&#8217;s goal, <a title="according to CEO Tim Armstrong" href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/28/ok-seriously-what-is-yahoo/">according to CEO Tim Armstrong</a>: &#8220;AOL is planning on being the largest <strong>high quality</strong> content producer for digital media.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bradford boasts, &#8220;I believe our <strong>quality</strong> stands on its own.&#8221;</p>
<p>See the recurring theme? But with all the posturing, here&#8217;s the big question: Who will be the arbiter of content quality? How will big brand advertisers decide which content brands they can trust with their brand?</p>
<p>To get big brand advertisers, you&#8217;ve got to have reach, but to really get brand advertising at scale, you&#8217;ve got to have the highest quality content brands &#8212; because <a title="it matters to advertisers:" href="http://adage.com/mediaworks/article?article_id=144286">it matters to advertisers:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think these guys are not building trusted media brands,&#8221; Brian Monahan, senior VP at Universal McCann, said of the general landscape of low-cost content. He sees these entities as closer to niche enthusiast magazines rather than newspapers. &#8220;They&#8217;re never going to take the place of a Condé Nast or some other trusted premium editorial voice,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just ask all of the traditional media content brands that still get a <a title="disproportionate share" href="http://cdixon.org/2009/12/26/why-the-web-economy-will-continue-growing-rapidly/">disproportionate share</a> of big brand advertising, and whose brand power is a big reason why those dollars haven&#8217;t followed consumers onto the web&#8230; yet.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no surprise, then, that Demand Media and Associated Content have eagerly <a title="pursued distribution deals" href="http://adage.com/mediaworks/article?article_id=143565">pursued distribution deals</a> with the trusted content brands that can burnish their brands in the eyes of consumers and in the eyes of advertisers. Brands like <a title="San Francisco Chronicle, Houston Chronicle" href="http://industry.bnet.com/technology/10008183/content-mill-demand-media-expands-its-reach-to-newspapers-exclusive/">San Francisco Chronicle, Houston Chronicle</a>, Atlanta-Journal Constitution, and USA Today. These are the content brands that already have the trust of advertiser brands, and it&#8217;s this trust that the new breed of demand-driven content producers rightly covets.</p>
<p>Demand Media, Associated Content, and Aol&#8217;s Seed are aiming to revolutionize the efficiency of content production. But a huge leap forward in efficiency won&#8217;t win the race unless they can also build brands that can attract brand advertising. Search may drive enormous traffic, but it doesn&#8217;t build content brands (ask any branded content site how well search visitors convert to loyal readers). Social media distribution (i.e. Twitter, Facebook) replaces the value of content brands with the value of personal relationships.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where the Content Graph comes in.</p>
<p>Aol just took a huge leap forward by efficiently leveraging the Daily Telegram&#8217;s brand to build the DailyFinance brand, taking the place of the Associated Press, one of the most widely known and trusted content brands.  And, critically, this happened without the kind corporate content distribution deal that is entirely lacking in the efficiency that Aol, Demand Media, and Yahoo are pioneering in content production.</p>
<p>For every revolution in content production, there is a corresponding revolution in content distribution.  The Content Graph is the revolution in efficient content distribution.</p>
<p>Daily Telegram, a node in the Content Graph, forged a direct connection with DailyFinance. Aol got free branding. And Daily Telegram not only got free content but lifted up its own brand by running better, more interesting content from DailyFinance than they could get from the AP.</p>
<p>Now, imagine DailyFinance content appearing in hundreds of newspapers around the world, rivaling the Associated Press as a primary source of business news &#8212; imagine the huge brand equity that Aol could build by being distributed by all of those trusted content brands.</p>
<p>Now imagine <em>every</em> high quality content brand, connected in the largest brand network in the world. Imagine the Content Graph <em>at scale</em>.</p>
<p>The Content Graph defines content quality for newer brands by mapping how their content is distributed by established brands. And it further defines the quality of established brands by mapping how they distribute newer content sources.</p>
<p>Think about how valuable that network would be to media companies for efficiently building and positioning their brands, to ensure that their content is distributed to the broadest possible audience in a way that delivers maximum brand value.</p>
<p>I highlighted the example of the Content Graph in print because there&#8217;s a huge near-term opportunity to build the Content Graph through a massive improvement in the efficiency of content distribution to print, and to leverage the value of those trusted brands while print still reaches tens of millions of news consumers.</p>
<p>But the Content Graph is entirely multiplatform, and ultimately a map of a global digital distribution network.<br />
On the web, the Content Graph isn&#8217;t just about the linking &#8212; it&#8217;s also distributing branded <em>full</em> content, rather than the <a title="inefficiency of re-writing each other's stories without attribution" href="http://daggle.com/mainstream-media-stole-news-story-credit-1906">inefficiency of content brands re-writing each other&#8217;s stories without attribution</a> or writing a cheap knock-off post that has a link but is meant to serve as a substitute. Instead, publishers could mutually benefit from the efficiency of distributing each other&#8217;s content &#8212; with permission and full control over terms of use &#8212; so that they can realize brand value of this distribution through the Content Graph.</p>
<p>Full content distribution on the web would of course still come with links to the source &#8212; the goal is to build the Content Graph in parallel with the link economy. Google could eventually use the Content Graph as a guide, e.g. to identify canonical sources.</p>
<p>The Content Graph also extends to mobile platforms, where publisher apps can be greatly enhanced by distributing content from a wide range of sources.  It&#8217;s about content brands as curators of the best content, anywhere, not just the content they can produce.</p>
<p>And what is the mutual business benefit for content brands in developing the Content Graph?</p>
<p>Think about the value of the Content Graph to a big brand advertiser, looking to not only maximize their reach on the web, but as important if not more, to maximize their brand value. Imagine how an advertiser evaluating DailyFinance could use the Content Graph to measure the brand&#8217;s distribution across of hundreds of trusted newspaper brands&#8230; and what if the ad dollars followed DailyFinance throughout the Content Graph?</p>
<p>And that gets to why this is a pivotal moment in the future of news.</p>
<p>A newspaper like The Daily Telegram can get ahead of the curve to benefit from the disruptive power of the web and the efficiency of content created for the web. If they had run this <a title="WalMart college story from WalletPop" href="http://www.walletpop.com/blog/2010/06/04/walmart-offering-college-credit-tuition-assistance-to-workers/">Walmart college story from WalletPop</a> in place of the AP story that appeared on the page, they could have gotten the content for that page entirely for free (along with the <a title="Dave Ramsey column" href="http://www.daveramsey.com/">Dave Ramsey column</a>), all by leveraging the value of their brand. And it&#8217;s by unlocking the value of its brand that newspapers like The Daily Telegram can survive and ultimately thrive in the digital age.</p>
<p>The Daily Telegram can become part of the largest network of high quality brands &#8212; the Content Graph &#8212; a network formed by the news brands themselves (not a middleman like the Associated Press), which can capture big brand advertising dollars as they migrate to the web.</p>
<p>And that is the future of news&#8230; a network of trusted news brands. And the corresponding future of brand advertising is in harnessing the power of this brand network.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Newspaper online advertising has not benefited greatly from the recent upswing in online ad spending, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/26/business/media/26adco.html?_r=1&amp;ref=business">according to the New York Times</a> and most of the recent newspaper company quarterly results. This is no surprise because most newspaper websites <a href="http://publishing2.com/2007/07/26/online-publishers-need-to-stop-selling-space/">sell SPACE</a> for commodity advertising &#8212; display ads and classifieds &#8212; and thus are hard pressed to compete with ad networks that specialize in selling commodity ad space by the megaton (or giving it away for free, in the case of Craigslist).</p>
<p>Back when newspapers where the only game in town for ad space, they could charge whatever they wanted. Now the web has near infinite ad space, and newspapers find themselves playing the wrong game. They&#8217;ve got ad sales staff that specialize in commodity order fulfillment and not premium advertising solutions.</p>
<p>So what distinguishes a premium ad solution from commodity ad space? It&#8217;s a premium solution if not every site can deliver the value. Any site can slap a display ad on a page &#8212; that&#8217;s what makes it a commodity. High-end brand publishers like newspapers  really have only one way to distinguish themselves from every other web publisher on the planet &#8212; their ability to create high quality content that attracts a targeted, high quality audience.</p>
<p><span id="more-1558"></span>But&#8230; there are many sites that specialize in creating &#8220;good enough&#8221; content that can attract segments of that high quality audience, and then selling that audience at a much lower cost.</p>
<p>But wait, you say, high-end brand publishers should be able to sell the ad next to their higher quality content at a higher price. Isn&#8217;t that the whole principle behind premium publishing?</p>
<p>Not when it comes to display advertising. Display advertising isn&#8217;t more valuable when placed next to premium content because display advertising has so LITTLE value to begin with. In fact, display advertising creates so little consumer value that it actually SUBTRACTS value from high quality editorial content when placed next it. Ever see those belly fat ads on top tier news sites? Dancing Martians lowering your mortgage payments? Whiten your teeth? It&#8217;s a total train wreck.</p>
<p>In fact, many ad exchanges are focused on bundling and selling audiences in a way that exploits this commodization of display ads and effectively cuts out the value of the publisher.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s a high-end brand publisher to do?</p>
<p>The answer is to offer advertising solutions that give advertisers the opportunity to create REAL consumer value; the kind of value that complements and even enhances the value of high quality editorial content; the kind of value that high-end brand publishers specialize in creating.</p>
<p>Many advertisers have sought this kind of premium value from high-end brand publishers, and most publishers have responded with customized solutions like the classic &#8220;microsite&#8221; or one-off customized ads. But that too can be a losing proposition. Case in point from Mercedes:</p>
<blockquote><p>It was a good day for newspaper Web sites when Mercedes-Benz USA introduced its updated E-Class cars this summer. Mercedes bought out the ad space on the home pages of The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, and had those sites create special 3-D ads for them, at an estimated cost of $100,000 a site.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>When Mercedes advertises its more basic models next year, it will largely avoid newspaper Web sites and rely on networks. That lets Mercedes “be very targeted and efficient with our dollars,” said Beth Lange, digital media specialist for Mercedes-Benz USA.</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem with these solutions is they don&#8217;t scale &#8212; they are expensive for publishers to deliver, and they are expensive for advertisers to buy. The result is most advertisers are lured back by the siren song of commodity ad network cost efficiency. So while high-end brand publishers do well for big splashy launches, they can&#8217;t compete when advertisers go into the post-launch mode of consistent, continuous, high ROI value creation.</p>
<p>What high-end publishers need is a way for advertisers to create premium value for consumers that scales and can deliver a consistent, continuous ROI that justifies a premium over commodity ad networks.</p>
<p>What would advertisers be willing to pay a consistent premium for? The holy grail of every advertiser &#8212; to become media, i.e. to create high quality content that attracts and retains an audience of current and prospective customers. Advertisers would also pay a premium to align the value that they create for the consumer with the value that high-end brand publishers create for consumers &#8212; just like on a search results page, where the ads are as valuable as the &#8220;editorial&#8221; content.</p>
<p>But if every high-end brand publisher tries to deliver such a solution by themselves, it won&#8217;t scale for advertisers. The key is to scale across many high-end brand sites while still delivering the kind of premium value that commands premium pricing.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the next generation of premium online advertising. More in my next post.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In response to the launch of <a href="http://fastflip.googlelabs.com/">Google&#8217;s Fast Flip</a>, I observed that <a href="http://publishing2.com/2009/09/14/what-google-understands-about-the-future-of-news-and-publishing-that-publishers-do-not/">Google is correctly focused on creating a new user interface for news</a>, when most media companies are not. A lot of people responded that Fast Flip is not an innovative or effective UI for news &#8212; which may be true, but that misses the point entirely.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter so much whether Google succeeds or fails with this particular experiment. What matters is that they are trying to solve the right problem.</p>
<p>The challenge for media companies is not to figure out what to do with their content &#8212; content in and of itself doesn&#8217;t matter. It never has.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all about the package.</p>
<p>Newspaper articles don&#8217;t matter without a newspaper. Magazine articles don&#8217;t matter without a magazine. TV shows don&#8217;t matter without a broadcast or cable channel.</p>
<p><span id="more-1552"></span>Newspapers&#8217; inability to generate the same revenue online as in print has nothing to do with content. It&#8217;s because on the web they are no longer in the business of packaging content, and that&#8217;s what the newspaper business, like every other media business, has always been about. Instead, media companies put their content on the web and let search and other aggregators package it.</p>
<p>An individual content item on the web, without a package, has marginal value approaching zero &#8212; and attempting to charge for an individual item of content is unlikely to change that. What you CAN charge for is the package.</p>
<p>Media companies need to be doing what Google is doing &#8212; experimenting with new ways to package content, which in a digital media world means new UIs and new ways to aggregate.</p>
<p>The nature of innovation is that many experiments will fail along the way. The key is to be aimed at solving the right problem.</p>
<p>Focus on the package. Whoever controls the package wins.</p>
<p>Ask newspapers. Or Google.</p>
<p>Oh, and while we&#8217;re on the subject of Fast Flip, lots of people overlooked one of the key words in the product name &#8212; FAST. Why does fast matter? How long does it take to get a result when you search on Google? Not long at all. In fact it&#8217;s darn FAST. (You can even see how long your Google search took in the blue bar across the top of the search results page.)</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why it matters &#8212; to the tune of $20 billion.  Here&#8217;s <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=3925">Marissa Mayer on the importance of being fast</a>. Google has the most successful UI and content package in the history of the web, that created one of the most lucrative business models in the history of media, so don&#8217;t write them off too quickly.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google knows a lot about the future of news &#8212; more than many publishers. It&#8217;s evident in Google&#8217;s new product, <a href="http://fastflip.googlelabs.com/">Fast Flip</a>, which allows news consumers to &#8220;flip&#8221; through news stories. What&#8217;s striking about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/15/technology/internet/15google.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">Fast Flip</a> is that Google is innovating precisely where publishers used to lead innovation.</p>
<p>Fast Flip is a new package for news.</p>
<p>The publishing business has always been about packaging content. Newspapers. Magazines. Newsletters</p>
<p>In digital media, on the web, the news package is now a function of software &#8212; which is why Google is innovating precisely where publishers are not.</p>
<p><span id="more-1542"></span>Fast Flip is, more accurately, an attempt to create a new UI for news &#8212; a better way to consume publishers&#8217; content than publishers provide on their own sites.</p>
<p>Most publishers are focused on how to charge for news. But there&#8217;s very little talk about how to innovate the packaging of news, much less a new UI for news. There&#8217;s very little talk about how people consume news on the web, about the value of aggregating articles from multiple sources, about solving consumers&#8217; problems rather than publishers&#8217; problems.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Google is taking the lead on figuring out how to create the new news package, and why they will continue to control the lucrative front end of distribution, while publishers are left with far less profitable back end of content creation.</p>
<p>Google is <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2009/09/google-sharing-revenue-with-publishers-for-first-time/">sharing revenue with publishers</a> because Fast Flip goes way beyond linking to actually partially reproducing entire web pages. And publishers will have to be content with the revenue that Google shares.</p>
<p>Unless they finally decide to compete on the real playing field that will determine the future of news and publishing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Journalists are news companies&#8217; most valuable assets.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/30/what-if-the-new-new-york-times/">Mike Arrington asserts</a>, and I think he&#8217;s right (disregard the &#8220;failing old media&#8221; rhetoric):</p>
<blockquote><p>And earlier today I got a glimpse at what AOL is up to &#8211; they are hiring all the journalists being fired and laid off by the newspapers and magazines. And they now have a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/29/aol-newsroom-now-has-wow-1500-writers/">news room 1,500 journalists and editors strong</a>. Amazingly, failing old media is throwing away their <strong>most valuable assets</strong>. And AOL is eagerly picking those assets up for a song. Before anyone knows it, AOL may be the most powerful news outlet in the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Given that NYT has gone to great lengths to avoid newsroom layoffs, I suspect they know full well how valuable their journalists are.</p>
<p><span id="more-1456"></span>Mike Arrington is TechCrunch&#8217;s most valuable asset, for his personal brand and for the quality of the post he writes.</p>
<p>As Arrington points out, AOL CEO Tim Armstrong has also realized how valuable journalists are, and is aligning AOL&#8217;s new strategy with <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/29/aol-newsroom-now-has-wow-1500-writers/">cornering the market for journalist talent</a>.</p>
<p>But is Arrington right that media companies are blithely throwing away their most valuable asset? Why did newspapers make so many newsroom cuts on their <a href="http://www.contentbridges.com/2009/07/can-you-feel-the-bottom.html">path back to profitability</a>? Is it because they don&#8217;t recognize the value of their journalists?</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s because they are still wrestling with the declining value of their other major asset: industrial printing and distribution capacity, i.e. printing presses and delivery trucks and all their industrial staff. While some newspapers have made significant cuts to their industrial operation by not <a href="http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=131&amp;aid=162785">delivering</a> or <a href="http://www.mlive.com/flintforward/index.ssf/2009/03/flint_journal_to_publish_3days.html">publishing</a> everyday (and a few have taken the extreme step of <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2009/03/16/news/companies/Seattle_PI/index.htm">ending their industrial operation entirely</a>), most have protected this asset because it is not really variable &#8212; it&#8217;s mostly all or nothing.</p>
<p>But to say that the value of industrial printing and distribution capacity is declining is not to say it has no value &#8212; it of course still generates most of newspaper company revenues. But the decline, while exacerbated to a large degree by the recession, is still secular long-term. (And newspaper companies are surely using the breathing room they achieved through cost reduction-driven profitability to figure out their long-term strategies &#8212; and they are focused on digital.)</p>
<p>AOL, in contrast, has no industrial assets, so has the latitude to invest in journalists. They also have another huge asset that newspapers enjoyed in their geographic distribution areas that they entirely lack on the web: SCALE</p>
<p>A notable illustration of the shifting value of news company assets that sits between AOL and most newspaper companies is <a href="http://politico.com">Politico</a>.</p>
<p>Politico rose to prominence by showcasing its high profile journalists on its website.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1460" title="Politico Blogs" src="http://publishing2.com/images/Politico-Blogs.png" alt="Politico Blogs" width="324" height="306" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1461" title="Politico Ben Smith" src="http://publishing2.com/images/Politico-Ben-Smith.png" alt="Politico Ben Smith" width="459" height="206" /></p>
<p>Unlike most news sites, Politico has real <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2009/08/wolff200908?printable=true&amp;currentPage=all">profile pages for its journalists</a> and showcases their bylines on every story (even the lead homepage story):</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1459" title="Politico headline byline" src="http://publishing2.com/images/Politico-headline-byline-475x115.png" alt="Politico headline byline" width="475" height="115" /></p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean, however, that Politico derives no value from industrial printing and distribution. In fact, half of their $15 million in annual revenue comes from a print edition published three days a week when congress is in session, and once week otherwise (via <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2009/08/wolff200908?printable=true&amp;currentPage=all">Vanity Fair</a>).</p>
<p>But Politico doesn&#8217;t own any printing presses or delivery trucks, i.e. no industrial assets. And the print publication is largely the product of content produced first for the web &#8212; and it is very much a &#8220;<a href="http://blogs.harvardbusiness.org/haque/2009/07/the_nichepaper_manifesto.html">nichepaper</a>,&#8221; i.e. it targets the highly valuable audience of Capitol Hill staffers and members of Congress.</p>
<p>The results is that Politico is able to invest in a talented newsroom staff of 100, paying nearly as much as The Washington Post. And Politico is profitable.</p>
<p>But does focusing on journalists as news companies&#8217; most valuable asset mean that news companies should be exclusively in the content production business? That&#8217;s a significant shift from the industrial printing and distribution business.</p>
<p>In the digital media world, companies like Google and Apple have taken over, as <a href="http://newsosaur.blogspot.com/2009/05/what-would-google-do-about-newspapers.html">Columbia J School Dean and former WSJ.com managing editor Bill Grueskin</a> put it, the <span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;profitable front end of the distribution chain</span>,&#8221; leaving news companies with the much less profitable back end of the value chain (i.e. content creation).</p>
<p>But what if journalists could also be the key to news companies getting back into the distribution business, in digital media?</p>
<p>The greatest asset of Google, the most successful content distribution business on the web, is its ability to <a href="http://publishing2.com/2009/04/11/how-google-stole-control-over-content-distribution-by-stealing-links/">harness the judgment of every person who creates a hyperlink on the web</a>, and to know which links from which sites represent more trusted judgment.</p>
<p>News companies still employ in their newsrooms arguably the greatest collective source of news judgment.</p>
<p>So how can news companies leverage the asset of their journalists&#8217; news judgment?</p>
<p>Hint #1: Collaboration</p>
<p>Hint #2: Scale</p>
<p>News companies are notably trying to figure out how to get into the business of charging for content on the web. As Apple&#8217;s iTunes demonstrated, the key to charging for content is in effective and highly convenient packaging.</p>
<p>Could journalists be the key to not only creating the content but also packaging it?</p>
<p>Think about that for a while. More in another post.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The New York Times <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/">technology blog, Bits</a>, which features original online reporting by all of the NYT technology journalists, has formally launched a new feature called &#8220;<a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/16/new-feature-on-bits-what-were-reading/?ref=technology">What We&#8217;re Reading</a>.&#8221; This feature (powered by <a href="http://www.publish2.com/">Publish2</a>) illustrates a number of important best practices for how journalists and news orgs can create significant value for readers by curating the web. I&#8217;ve got six of them for you.</p>
<p>But first, here&#8217;s what the feature looks like, in the blog&#8217;s right sidebar, under the ad at the top (click for larger image):</p>
<p><a href="http://publishing2.com/images/New-Feature-on-Bits-What-Were-Reading.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1426" title="New Feature on Bits What We're Reading" src="http://publishing2.com/images/New-Feature-on-Bits-What-Were-Reading2-475x473.jpg" alt="New Feature on Bits What We're Reading" width="475" height="473" /></a></p>
<p>And here are the six best practices:<br />
<span id="more-1417"></span></p>
<h3>1. Make it a collaborative effort.</h3>
<p>With all that journalists are being asked to do on the web, it&#8217;s not ideal from a workflow perspective for one reporter or editor to carry the burden of curating the web. Bit&#8217;s &#8220;What We&#8217;re Reading,&#8221; like the blog, is a collaborative effort of NYT technology journalists as a group:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Bits Widget 2" src="http://blog.publish2.com/images/2009/06/bits-6-4-09.jpg" alt="" width="341" height="323" /></p>
<p>Here are all of the NYT technology journalists contributing to What We&#8217;re Reading (via a <a href="http://www.publish2.com/newsgroups/nyt-technology-journalists/">Publish2 newsgroup</a>, designed to enable this type of collaboration):</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1429" title="New York Times Technology Journalists" src="http://publishing2.com/images/New-York-Times-Technology-Journalists.jpg" alt="New York Times Technology Journalists" width="407" height="338" /></p>
<p>The Bits blog is &#8220;aiming to identify a dozen or so items every weekday,&#8221; which is much easier with a dozen contributors than with one.</p>
<h3>2. Comment to explain why the link is worth clicking.</h3>
<p>Next to search, the greatest driver of traffic on the web is social recommendations, i.e. person-to-person recommendations. TechCrunch, for example, now <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/14/for-techcrunch-twitter-traffic-a-statistical-breakdown/">gets nearly 10% of its traffic from Twitter</a>, which is simply people recommending links to each other.</p>
<p>When people recommend something to each other, they typically say something about what they are recommending. This distinguishes personal recommendations from machine recommendations &#8212; algorithms can automatically pull the lede, but they can&#8217;t tell you what they think or highlight what&#8217;s interesting about a story.</p>
<p>NYT tech journalists make the What We&#8217;re Reading feature much more valuable &#8212; and differentiated from headlines produced by algorithms &#8212; by adding a comment to every link:</p>
<p><img title="NYT Bits Widget 7-16-09" src="http://publishing2.com/images/NYT-Bits-Widget-7-16-09.jpg" alt="NYT Bits Widget 7-16-09" width="365" height="341" /></p>
<p>As New York Times deputy  technology editor Vindu Goel observes, &#8220;readers should know why you are recommending a certain item so they can decide whether it&#8217;s worth their time to check out.&#8221;</p>
<p>You can think of it as a mini-blog, since blogging grew out of sharing links along with what you think about what you&#8217;re linking to.</p>
<h3>3. Attribute links to individual journalists.</h3>
<p>This best practice follows from commenting on each link. People click on links in Twitter, in Facebook, or in email based on WHO recommended it to them. Blogs on news sites are a great way for journalists to build up their personal brands &#8212; sharing what they&#8217;re reading is an extension of that.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Bits Widget 3" src="http://blog.publish2.com/images/2009/06/bits-widget-5-22-09.jpg" alt="" width="365" height="375" /></p>
<h3>4. Share links on Twitter.</h3>
<p>Speaking of Twitter, NYT Bits journalists also share what they&#8217;re reading with Bits&#8217; 6,700 followers on Twitter (automatically through the Publish2 newsgroup). Sharing links was Bits&#8217; first foray beyond what most news orgs do with a Twitter account, i.e. auto-post their own headlines, and it&#8217;s a significant enhancement to the value of their Twitter feed.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1430" title="NYTBits Twitter" src="http://publishing2.com/images/NYTBits-Twitter-474x406.jpg" alt="NYTBits Twitter" width="474" height="406" /></p>
<p>One of the easiest ways for a news org to enhance its Twitter feed &#8212; and be more like individuals with lots of Twitter followers &#8212; is to share links to interesting things. It&#8217;s a fundamentally social practice.</p>
<p>Following best practice #2 each link shared on Twitter has the journalist&#8217;s comment (rather than the link&#8217;s title), and following best practice #3, each has the journalist&#8217;s initials after the comment, e.g. ^SH is Saul Hansell (again, done automatically via Publish2 newsgroup).</p>
<h3>5. Integrate into existing workflow.</h3>
<p>The What We&#8217;re Reading feature is well named, both as a simple description for readers and as a literal description of the workflow behind it.  As Vindu observed:  &#8220;As journalists, we&#8217;re constantly looking at news coverage, blogs and Web sites. Why not share the most interesting stuff we find with our readers?&#8221;</p>
<p>And the time required?</p>
<p>Vindu: &#8220;Less than a minute, which was really important to us. Publish2 worked with us to configure the selection tool to automatically include a lot of the key information, such as our Twitter feed. So when I find an item I want to share, I click on a button in my Web browser, edit the headline of the linked article if necessary (sometimes they are really long or incomplete), add a public comment and hit &#8220;Save&#8221; to send it out to the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>The link is automatically added to What We&#8217;re Reading via Publish2. No need to log in to a CMS or even leave the page that they&#8217;re reading.</p>
<p>Previously, interesting items that NYT technology journalists came across that didn&#8217;t make it into a NYT print article or a Bits blog post ended up on the &#8220;cutting room floor.&#8221; The only change to workflow is they are now sharing those interesting items with their readers &#8212; on the blog and on Twitter in one step.</p>
<h3>6. Complement original reporting.</h3>
<p>What We&#8217;re Reading, positioned high in the right sidebar, serves as a perfect complement to the original reporting in the main blog on the left. Curating the web, like blogging, should be a fundamental skill of every journalist who wants to create value in a web media world.</p>
<p>Vindu: &#8220;There&#8217;s is a lot of great information out there on the Web that isn&#8217;t produced by The Times. Our overarching goal as a news institution is to inform our readers. Often that&#8217;s with outside content. So What We&#8217;re Reading is part of a broader effort by The Times to feature strong third-party content on our site. For example, we have modules on our Technology home page, <a href="www.nytimes.com/technology">www.nytimes.com/technology</a>, that show stories from respected tech blogs such as <a href="http://readwriteweb.com">ReadWriteWeb</a> and <a href="http://gigaom.com">GigaOM</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lastly: Should Bits fear &#8220;sending readers away&#8221;? No more than Google or Drudge Report should. Do a great job sending readers to interesting content on the web, and they&#8217;ll keep coming back for more.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New York venture capitalist Fred Wilson is one of the most prolific and renown bloggers on the web.  And if you go his blog, <a href="http://avc.com/" target="_blank">avc.com</a>, you&#8217;ll notice that (like most blogs) he runs advertising to generate revenues.  But what many of you may not know is that all the proceeds Fred generates through his blog goes to <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2006/02/fm_publishing.html" target="_blank">charity</a>.  What a concept!!  You blog for a few minutes each day, and presto!  You&#8217;re supporting your favorite charity!  Now, imagine if millions of people did this&#8230; imagine the impact we could have on the world.</p>
<p>Starting today, if you&#8217;re a blogger who uses <a href="http://wordpress.com/" target="_blank">WordPress</a>, (both hosted .com as well as .org) you can do precisely that.  Through a <a href="http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-wordpress-lets-bloggers-give-back-with-socialvibe" target="_blank">newly-launched partnership</a>, WordPress and <a href="http://socialvibe.com/" target="_blank">SocialVibe</a> (disclosure: I am on the board) are introducing a widget that will enable millions of bloggers that use WordPress to support their charities of choice.</p>
<p><span id="more-1407"></span>With the SocialVibe widget, bloggers can donate real money to their charities without the need to dip into their own pockets.  Instead, the money is generated from brand advertisers that the bloggers self-select as the sponsor (e.g. Showtime, Sprint, Colgate, Kraft Foods, etc.).  To be more specific, once bloggers install the SocialVibe sidebar widget on their WordPress blog, money will be earned for charities every time readers engage with the widget (e.g. rating a Showtime video clip).  Bloggers can switch their cause and sponsor as often as they like, and receive regular updates from their charity about goal progress and impact.</p>
<p>Thus far, SocialVibe has enabled people to raise close to half a million dollars for charities in just over a year’s time.  Everyday, members are sharing their brand sponsors with millions of friends on social platforms such as MySpace, Facebook, and now WordPress to benefit one of more than 30 non-profit organizations, such as World Food Program, Children’s Miracle Network and charity: water.</p>
<p>What makes this partnership especially interesting is that WordPress has, up to this point, restricted any advertising on hosted accounts (with the exception of VIP accounts).  In the past they have expressed concern over advertising’s impact on spam and motivation for expression.  While these concerns no doubt still exist, there are a few facets of the SocialVibe platform that may make the advertising program more palatable:</p>
<p>•    The blogger can choose to engage with a brand partner or not.<br />
•    The benefit to the blogger comes not in $ dollars (or a check), but rather in the form of a donation to a charity.<br />
•    The ad unit, with charity graphics and links to relevant information, adds to the content of the site, rather than detracting from the experience as most advertising programs do.</p>
<p>So it is possible that the SocialVibe widget will motivate bloggers to create even better content and engage a larger audience, knowing that they now have a way to pool their individual influences to create positive change in the world.  And it&#8217;s important to realize that the WordPress-SocialVibe partnership is designed to align such altruistic desires with the many corporations and brands that increasingly <a href="http://www.mediapost.com/publications/index.cfm?fa=Articles.showArticle&amp;art_aid=104039" target="_blank">value social responsibility</a>.  For the brands involved, this platform provides a golden opportunity to get unique endorsements in a highly engaging manner within social media.  It&#8217;s a win for all parties involved.</p>
<p>For more information about the SocialVibe-WordPress widget, check out the <a href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2009/06/15/socialvibe/" target="_blank">WordPress blog post</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Originally posted at <a href="http://beatblogging.org/2009/06/11/why-we-link-a-brief-rundown-of-the-reasons-your-news-organization-needs-to-tie-the-web-together/">BeatBlogging.org</a>, a resource for journalists using social networks, blogs, and other Web tools to improve beat reporting.</em></p>
<p>Whenever I talk with news organizations of any size about linking to sources, resources and journalism that originated outside the walls of their newsroom, two questions come up: How and Why.</p>
<p>Well, conveniently enough, I work for <a href="http://publish2.com/">Publish2</a>, and we build tools that help answer the question of How. If your problem is that systems make adding links directly in the text of your story a difficult task, let’s solve that by adding links in widgets, sidebars, scrolling across the bottom of the browser window, blinking in 96pt red Helvetica, pushed to Twitter — wherever and however you want them.</p>
<p>My standing offer on How is that if the question comes up, you can talk to me and I’ll help you out.</p>
<p>So back to the question of Why.</p>
<p><strong>Why we link: Five reasons your news organization should tie the Web together</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-1397"></span></p>
<p><strong>1.  Because we owe it to our readers to give them as much information as we have at our fingertips.</strong></p>
<p>Don’t we?  Of course we do.</p>
<p>If you’re a journalist, a huge part of your job is to filter all the information relevant to your community or your beat and pass along the important parts to your readers. Think about all the press releases you get by fax or e-mail, all the phone calls, voicemail, and messages that land on your desk, and think about how you act as a filter for that flood of information. Do the same thing with the Web.</p>
<p>Bring your readers the best links related to your story, and they will thank you. How? By treating you like a first-class citizen of the Internet, and coming back to your news site, which is no longer a dead end backwater in the river of news, but a point of connection where they can find other interesting streams.</p>
<p><a href="http://chrisamico.com/blog/">Chris Amico</a> took it one step further in a tip he submitted via <a href="http://ryansholin.com/2009/06/03/whats-the-most-important-reason-news-organizations-should-link-out-to-the-wider-web/">the Publish2 Collaborative Reporting form I used to gather some ideas for this post</a>.  <em>“Humility is healthy,”</em> Chris wrote. <em>“The more we get out of this mindset that we are the sole producers of useful content, the better off we’ll be in the long run.” </em></p>
<hr /><strong>2.  Because linking to sources and resources is the key gesture to being a citizen <em>of</em> the Web and not just a product <em>on</em> the Web.</strong></p>
<p>You might think your news organization is super-duper-Web-savvy because you put your stories online, have RSS feeds and push links to your own content out via social networks, including Twitter.</p>
<p><strong>That’s Step One.</strong> And it’s a good first step.</p>
<p>But, if all you provide your readers is flat content that doesn’t take them anywhere else on the Web, or back up statements with direct sources, or provide resources for those who want to explore a topic beyond what you’ve been able to provide with original reporting, you’re just shoveling text into another bucket, one labeled “Web.”</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, you want to embrace the traits that make blogs, Twitter, and so many other online communication tools a vital part of the daily life of your readers, your news site shouldn’t feel like an endpoint in the conversation. It should feel like the beginning.</p>
<p><a href="http://oneiros.gr/blog/">Asteris Masouras</a> put it this way in a Twitter reply to my query about why we link:</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/asteris/statuses/2022209801"><img title="http://twitter.com/asteris" src="http://ryansholin.com/images/guest/asteris.png" alt="Links are the lifeblood of the web. It's counterintuitive &amp; suspect for journos not to link whenever possible." /></a></p>
<hr /><strong>3. Because it’s the best way to connect directly with the online community in our town.</strong></p>
<p>If you’re writing about human beings, businesses, organizations, government institutions or any other life form with a presence on the Internet, linking to them in the stories you publish about them is the low-hanging fruit when it comes to participating in your local online community.</p>
<p>Skipping the link to the city council’s calendar when you mention the next meeting, leaving out the link to the Little League’s online scoreboard when you write a story about its resurgence or not bothering to link to the full database of restaurant inspections when you choose three to write about — these are all easy ways to miss an opportunity to connect with your community and your readers.</p>
<p><strong>Start simple:  If you mention a person or organization, link to them.</strong></p>
<p>Many, many bonus points to be awarded if you dig deep enough into the local online community to link to relevant content created by the people in your story. Did that angry neighbor’s crusade for a new zoning law to govern branches that hang over someone else’s driveway start with an image posted to a photo-sharing site and a determined comment? <em>Link to it.</em></p>
<p>There’s a huge upside to linking out to community members, of course. Sometimes they link back.</p>
<p>Wenatchee World Web Editor <a href="http://blogs.wenatcheeworld.com/author/bpruitt/">Brianne Pruitt</a> dropped a tip in my form including the following statement: <em>“The link economy is real, and important for anyone who wants to be a part of the Web ecology.” </em>I’d translate that as: Give some, get some.</p>
<p>And here’s how Web developer <a href="http://pkarl.com/">Pete Karl</a> answered the question of why news organizations should link to external sources:</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/steyblind/statuses/2022468986"><img title="http://twitter.com/steyblind" src="http://ryansholin.com/images/guest/steyblind.png" alt="To give them the slightest chance of getting noticed." /></a></p>
<hr /><strong>4. Because we absolutely do not know everything, but we know where to find out most of what we don’t know.</strong></p>
<p>The days of your news organization existing as a monopolistic source of local information are over, and your readers know it. They browse local, national, international, and topical news and commentary in more places than you call “news.” And if they don’t, they hear it from their friends on any one of a dozen social networks. They know that you don’t know it all. And so do you.</p>
<p><strong>But you’re the journalist. </strong></p>
<p>You’re the filter. You’re the person in town who knows everyone who knows everyone. You’ve got the sources, whether they’re people you talk to at the community center, the city council meeting, the police station, or their Live Journal page. Bring what they know to your readers as directly as possible: <strong>Link to them.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.digidave.org/">David Cohn</a> of <a href="http://spot.us/">Spot.Us</a> offered up <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/2007/02/22/new-rule-cover-what-you-do-best-link-to-the-rest/">the now-classic Jeff Jarvis line</a> in my tip form:  <em>“Do what you do best, and link to the rest.”</em></p>
<hr /><strong>5. Because it will make your job easier.</strong></p>
<p>I know, I know. Everyone is asking you to do more with less. It’s extremely easy to tell people like me that you just don’t have time for another toy, another tool, another camera, another social network or another task.</p>
<p><strong>I’m here to tell you that bringing your readers the best of the Web can save you work.</strong></p>
<p>How? By opening a two-way channel to let your readers tell you what you should link to next, you’ll cut down on the time you spend looking for that next thing. By maintaining a real presence in the local link economy, you’ll make it easier for sources who know the answers to your questions to find you, and you won’t spend as much time trying to find them.</p>
<p>By sending your readers to the best information available on the Web, you’ll keep them coming back for more, drawing more traffic to your news site. Last time I checked, more traffic is one way to make more money, and with any luck, that’s still how you get paid.</p>
<hr /><strong>Bonus Links on Links:</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If the wire editor and feature editor roles are becoming obsolete for print newspapers, as <a href="http://www.yelvington.com/obsolete-jobs-wire-editor-features-editor">Steve Yelvington persuasively argues</a>, then those editors should be retrained &#8212; or retrain themselves &#8212; as web curators. Rather than become obsolete, these editors could become essential to their news organization&#8217;s future on the web.</p>
<p>Steve observes:</p>
<blockquote><p>On the Internet, we have no need of wire editors; if we wish to have wire content on our websites, we can plug in AP Hosted News, or run a full feed of AP Online or some similar product from another service. But with everything on the Internet just a click away, the value of such branded and hosted wire content is low (and measurable), and even that may go away before long, based on simple cost-benefit analysis. We may be better off sending users to CNN, MSNBC and NYtimes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Feature editing faces the same problem:</p>
<blockquote><p>But the job simply doesn&#8217;t transport to digital media. Again, everything on the planet is just a click away, much of it more interesting, entertaining and informative than can be found in the typical daily newspaper&#8217;s features.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yet there is a HUGE opportunity in this shifting landscape. Just because there&#8217;s a wealth of content a click away doesn&#8217;t mean that news consumers know where to click in order to find it.</p>
<p><span id="more-1378"></span>Instead, we have what <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13505_3-10142298-16.html">Clay Shirky describes as &#8220;filter failure&#8221;</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Here&#8217;s what the Internet did: it introduced, for the first time, post-Gutenberg economics. The cost of producing anything by anyone has fallen through the floor. And so there&#8217;s no economic logic that says that you have to filter for quality before you publish&#8230;The filter for quality is now way downstream of the site of production.</p>
<p>What we&#8217;re dealing with now is not the problem of information overload, because we&#8217;re always dealing (and always have been dealing) with information overload&#8230;<strong>Thinking about information overload isn&#8217;t accurately describing the problem; thinking about filter failure is.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Local news sites may serve their readers much better by sending them to CNN, MSNBC, and NYT for non-local news, as Steve suggests. But they may also send them to local news sites in other regions for stories dealing with common issues. They may send them to local blogs and other non-MSM media sites.</p>
<p>There is a wealth of sources on the web. Helping readers find the best of the web could help local news sites remain daily destinations rather than just a host for content to be aggregated by someone else &#8212; which could help those news operations get back into the content distribution business, which is how they made money in print, and how they could make a lot more money on the web.</p>
<p>Wire and feature editors are already skilled content curators &#8212; they just need to adapt those skills to filtering the web. One challenge they can apply their news judgment to is discovering new sources of trusted information, something <a href="http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=101&amp;aid=161441">Google CEO Eric Schmidt admits alogirthms struggle with</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>For general search, we&#8217;ve been careful not to bias it using our own judgment of trust because we&#8217;re never sure if we get it right. So we use complicated ranking signals, as they&#8217;re called, to determine rank and relevance. And we change them periodically, which drives everybody crazy, as or algorithms get better. There&#8217;s no question in my experience that the top brands represented in this room would, in fact, float to the top in our search ranking. <strong>The usual problem is you&#8217;ve got somebody who really is very trustworthy but they&#8217;re not as well-known and they compete against people who are better known, and they don&#8217;t, in their view, get high enough ranking. We have not come up with a way to algorithmically handle that in a coherent way.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Another skill that would help wire and feature editors take on the challenge of filtering the web, and make them hugely relevant in the web media era, is collaboration. They could learn a lot from the editors in Washington State who have been practicing collaborative curation, whether for a <a href="http://publishing2.com/2009/01/09/networked-link-journalism-a-revolution-quietly-begins-in-washington-state/">statewide flood</a> or a <a href="http://publishing2.com/2009/04/29/collaboration-cant-cure-swineflu-but-it-can-fight-filter-failure/">flu outbreak</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.publish2.com">Publish2</a>&#8216;s Senior Editor Josh Korr wrote about this vision for re-inventing the wire function on the web in a recent Nieman Reports piece, &#8220;<a href="http://www.nieman.harvard.edu/reportsitem.aspx?id=100710">A 21st Century Newswire—Curating the Web With Links</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>If I were a wire or feature editor in a newsroom, instead of waiting to become obsolete, I would start immediately learning how to be a top notch web curator. I&#8217;d ask myself &#8212; how can I become the Jim Romenesko or Matt Drudge for my community. I would start learning how to use the <a href="http://www.publish2.com">tools of web curation</a> and learning how to <a href="http://newscollaboration.ning.com/xn/detail/2937361:Event:501">collaborate with other web curators</a>. I&#8217;d study how newsrooms like Chicago Tribune have <a href="http://www.publish2.com/newsgroups/chicago-breaking-news/">created an editorial workflow</a> for collaborating to curate the web (see Colonel Tribune Recommends on the <a href="http://www.chicagobreakingnews.com/blog/">Chicago Breaking News blog</a>.)</p>
<p>And if I ran a newsroom, I&#8217;d look at how I could retrain and reassign talented to editors to be vital contributors to the web operation, even as their function becomes redundant for the print operation. (Or, I&#8217;d imagine a future where content from a diverse range of web sources could be licensed and curated for print &#8212; see this <a href="http://korrvalues.com/2008/02/20/how-to-fix-newspapers-iv-go-beyond-the-wires-join-the-web-party/">Josh Korr post</a>.)</p>
<p>There&#8217;s still time for any journalist in the newsroom to become essential to the future of news, rather than being emblematic of the past.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Perhaps you&#8217;ve noticed a bit of activity online the last few days related to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_swine_flu_outbreak">a certain not-quite-pandemic bug that&#8217;s going around</a>.</p>
<p>Swine Flu.</p>
<p>Or, to put it in microblogging terms, <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23swineflu">#swineflu</a>.</p>
<p>The wonderful thing about the ease of communication online is that anyone can start a discussion, carry it on, pass along information, retweet it, forward an e-mail, leave a comment on a blog post, or bookmark a page in a social way.</p>
<p>The problem, of course, is that when millions of people are desperately looking for solid, clear information, that&#8217;s when it can be the most difficult to find it.<span id="more-1360"></span></p>
<p>The <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23swineflu">#swineflu hashtag on Twitter</a> serves as a good point of reference for what Clay Shirky called &#8220;<a href="http://web2expo.blip.tv/file/1277460/">filter failure</a>.&#8221;  The problem is not that there&#8217;s a wild abundance of useful information, overloading us with detail, facts, and commentary; the problem is that we don&#8217;t have the proper filtering system set up to separate trusted sources and reliable resources from rumors, jokes, misinformation, and ephemera.  If those seeking to provide links to reliable information started using a hashtag such as <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23therealswineflu">#therealswineflu</a>, it would likely be overtaken &#8212; quickly &#8212; by tagged content with less value, whatever its source.</p>
<p>So how do we solve filter failure?</p>
<p>We depend on humans to serve as our filters.  We do this all the time, when we ask a friend a question, or talk with someone we know who happens to be an expert on a given topic.  (I imagine the world&#8217;s epidemeologists are fielding a huge number of Facebook messages from old friends this week.)</p>
<p>When it comes to reliable sources for news that breaks on a massive scale, our best sources are likely to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_swine_flu_outbreak">Wikipedia</a> for facts, and journalists for explanation, clarification, context, and meaningful analysis.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">+++</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One way that journalists are bringing explanation, clarification, context, and meaningful analysis of the Swine Flu story to their readers today is through <a href="http://publish2.com">Publish2</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We&#8217;ve been actively encouraging journalists and news organizations using Publish2 to use <a href="http://www.publish2.com/topics/swineflu/">the swineflu tag </a>to mark the stories and resources they&#8217;re saving to help their readers understand what they need to know about this outbreak, put it in context, and quickly respond to it as necessary.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Look for the &#8220;Create Widget&#8221; link near the top of every topic page on the Publish2 site to embed any stream of links on your own news site or blog.  The Knoxville News-Sentinel added the stream of all Publish2 links tagged with &#8220;swineflu&#8221; on <a href="http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2009/apr/27/swine-flu-resources-spreading-across-web/">a page to gather resources from around the Web</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So that&#8217;s one filter:  Journalists sharing reliable information to serve their readers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Want to drill down a little more?  How about a regional group of journalists at different news organizations gathering information in a collaborative effort to serve local readers?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the Pacific Northwest, <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23wanews">#wanews</a> has you covered.  This group of reporters and editors in and around Washington State <a href="http://blog.publish2.com/2009/01/09/networked-link-journalism-a-revolution-quietly-begins-in-washington-state/">first came together to use Publish2 to aggregate news and information when flooding hit the area earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It&#8217;s an innovative group, and this week has been no exception, as they&#8217;ve jumped in to form <a href="http://www.publish2.com/newsgroups/northwest-news/swineflu">a Publish2 newsgroup</a> where anyone they invite can post links and then embed the stream as a widget on their own site:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Wenatchee World <a href="http://wenatcheeworld.com/article/20090428/NEWS04/704289970?NCW-not-at-high-risk-for-swine-flu--health-district-official-says">embedded a &#8220;Northwest news links&#8221; stream in the sidebar of their stories</a> about Swine Flu.</li>
<li>The Walla Walla Union-Bulletin <a href="http://union-bulletin.com/special/swineflu/">added the feed of links to a special topic page</a> where they&#8217;re providing Swine Flu information to their readers.</li>
<li>The Kitsap Sun did both, with a sidebar on story pages and <a href="http://www.kitsapsun.com/swine-flu/">a stream embedded on a topic page</a> as well.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is so much misunderstanding flying around about the economics of content on the web and the role of Google in the web&#8217;s content economy that it&#8217;s making my head hurt. So let&#8217;s see if we can straighten things out.</p>
<p>Google isn&#8217;t stealing content from newspapers and other media companies. It&#8217;s stealing their control over distribution, which has always been the engine of profits in media. Google makes more money than any other media company on the web because it has near monopoly control over content distribution (i.e. like a metro newspaper in the pre web era).</p>
<p>Those who argue that Google is a friend to content owners because it sends them traffic overlook the basic law of supply and demand. The value of &#8220;traffic&#8221; is entirely relative. The more content there is on the web, the less value that content has &#8212; because of the surfeit of ad inventory and abundance of free alternatives to paid content &#8212; and thus the less value &#8220;traffic&#8221; has.</p>
<p>The more content there is on the web, the less money every content creator makes, and the more money Google makes by taking a piece of that transaction.</p>
<p><span id="more-1319"></span>Nick Carr <a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2009/04/google_in_the_m.php">sums up the problem well</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>What Google doesn&#8217;t mention is that the billions of clicks and the millions of ad dollars are so fragmented among so many thousands of sites that no one site earns enough to have a decent online business. Where the real money ends up is at the one point in the system where traffic <em>is</em> concentrated: the Google search engine. Google&#8217;s <a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2008/09/google_at_10.php">overriding interest</a> is to (a) maximize the amount and velocity of the traffic flowing through the web and (b) ensure that as large a percentage of that traffic as possible goes through its search engine and is exposed to its ads.</p></blockquote>
<p>The debate over whether Google&#8217;s excerpting content on its search result pages is a violation of copyright law, i.e. whether Google is effectively stealing content, overlooks the much more valuable asset that Google is appropriating. Google makes money less by its ability to display that snipet of content and much more by its ability to know that snipet of content is relevant to what the content consumer is looking for &#8212; it makes money by its ability to efficiently distribute that content.</p>
<p>And just how does Google know what content is most relevant, trustworthy, and valuable? How does Google know where to send the traffic that yields such diminishing returns?</p>
<p>Everyone talks about Google&#8217;s algorithms as if it were some giant artificial intelligence that had its own ability to judge the value of content.</p>
<p>The greatest irony of the web content economy is that Google by itself doesn&#8217;t have a clue what content is good or bad. Google is able to deliver relevant search results only because every site on the web helps them figure it out.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s algorithm is based on reading &#8220;links&#8221; as votes for content. Every time a website links to another website, Google reads that link as a vote. The brilliance of the Google algorithm is its ability to figure out which votes should count more.</p>
<p>But without those links, without those &#8220;votes,&#8221; Google has nothing.</p>
<p>What Google &#8220;steals&#8221; from every website isn&#8217;t the content &#8212; it&#8217;s the links.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the links, stupid. And everyone gives Google their links to read &#8212; for free!!</p>
<p>Google doesn&#8217;t really need your content, because there&#8217;s plenty more where it came from. What Google really needs is your links, i.e. your votes for content &#8212; it needs your help separating the wheat from the chaff on the web.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://joshua.schachter.org/2009/04/on-url-shorteners.html">backlash</a> against URL shorteners and site framing (e.g. <a href="http://www.joshuatopolsky.com/2009/04/10/why-engadget-is-blocking-the-diggbar/">DiggBar</a>) is all about who controls the links, and which links Google is going to read and credit.</p>
<p>The key to Google&#8217;s monopoly control over content distribution on the web is its ability to judge what&#8217;s most relevant in an increasingly large sea of content.</p>
<p>If media companies want to compete with Google, they need to look at the source of its power &#8212; judging good content, which enables Google to be the most efficient and effective distributor of content. They also need to look at Google&#8217;s fundamental limitation &#8212; its judgment is dependent on OTHER people expressing their judgment of content in the form of links. Above all, they need to look at sources of content judgment that Google currently can&#8217;t access, because they are not yet expressed as links on the web.</p>
<p>The balance of power on the web <a href="http://publishing2.com/2008/10/16/mainstream-news-organizations-entering-the-webs-link-economy-will-shift-the-balance-of-power-and-wealth/">can shift</a> &#8212; but only by understanding what the real sources of power are.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>
<p>Just to clarify,  the use of &#8220;steal&#8221; and &#8220;stole&#8217; is in the sense of &#8220;stole the game.&#8221; The point of this post is to explain how Google won, and not at all to suggest that they didn&#8217;t deserve to win. Google&#8217;s success is a direct reflection of how much value they create, i.e. A LOT &#8212; they solved a problem in the market that nobody else figure out how to solve or even recognized as the huge opportunity in the market. This post is also intended to help media companies understand better how Google works so that they can better compete in the web content marketplace, not to justify any feelings of &#8220;sour grapes.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Seattle Post-Intelligencer today because the first major metro newspaper to <a href="http://www.seattlepi.com/business/403793_piclosure17.html">stop publishing in print but keep the news brand alive on the web</a>. Seattlepi.com&#8217;s Executive Editor Michelle Nicolosi <a href="http://www.seattlepi.com/business/403794_newseattlepi.com16.html">promises bold experiments</a>, &#8220;to break a lot of rules that newspaper Web sites stick to.&#8221; And to be sure, the entire news industry will be watching to see what an editorial staff of 20 can accomplish compared to a staff of 165. (Given their intent to look &#8220;everywhere for efficiencies&#8221; &#8212; and that they won&#8217;t have &#8220;reporters, editors or producers—everyone will do and be everything&#8221; &#8212; I suspect they will accomplish more than most people think.)</p>
<p>But in addition to the key editorial question, Seattle has also now become a test case for one of the most important questions about the near-term future of the newspaper industry that is almost never asked:</p>
<p><strong>What will happen to the print advertising when the newspaper stops publishing in print?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://publishing2.com/2008/12/17/when-a-newspaper-stops-publishing-in-print-what-happens-to-the-print-advertising-dollars/"><span id="more-1285"></span>I asked this question</a> a few months ago in theory, but now we get to see what happens in actuality.  Logically, one or a combination of the following will happen to the newspaper&#8217;s advertising dollars:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Vaporizes</strong>, i.e. the advertiser stops spending the money &#8212; given the economic crisis, this seems likely for some advertisers</li>
<li><strong>Shifts to Seattlepi.com</strong> &#8212; which is hiring its own sales force following the dissolution of the joint operating agreement with the Seattle Times</li>
<li><strong>Shifts to another newspaper</strong>, i.e. Seattle Times &#8212; through the JOA, the same sales force sold ads for Seattle PI and Seattle Times, so it only makes sense that some advertisers will shift some or all of their spending to the Times</li>
<li><strong>Shifts to competing local online media</strong>, e.g. <a href="http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Home">The Stranger</a>, <a href="http://westseattleblog.com/blog/">West Seattle Blog</a></li>
<li><strong>Shifts to non-local media</strong> that can target local audiences, e.g. Google, Craigslist</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyone who runs a newspaper should be watching this experiment under a microscope. Someone should even go so far as to obtain copies of the last month of Seattle PI in print and call up every display advertiser and ask them what they plan to do.</p>
<p>This experiment has already been playing out in Denver since the Rocky Mountain News ceased publication, but since the Rocky ceased entirely, we didn&#8217;t get to see what happened with option #2 above &#8212; and that&#8217;s the BIG question for many newspaper companies looking at online-only publishing. (The experiment in Denver could be radically altered if a <a href="https://www.indenvertimes.com/">new publication is launched by former Rocky staff</a> &#8212; it&#8217;s contingent on whether they can <a href="http://www.iwantmyrocky.com/2009/03/16/former-rocky-staffers-to-start-online-news-site/">sell enough subscriptions</a>, which I hope they do because that is another vital experiment.)</p>
<p>So much of the discussion of the future of the newspaper business seemes to assume only option #1 above will occur. But that&#8217;s unlikely.</p>
<p>Of course the big question is whether local media can find new ways to create value &#8212; and I say &#8220;create value&#8221; because that is the key to any new business (vs. &#8220;new business model,&#8221; because those discussions typically start with what the business needs, not what the market needs). I think there are tremendous opportunities for new value creation in emerging collaborative media ecosystems, but that&#8217;s for another post.</p>
<p>In the meantime, all eyes are on Seattle.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, with the signing of the <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/227/story/62361.html" target="_blank">largest government stimulus program</a> in history, <a href="http://www.publish2.com">Publish2</a> is announcing a new initiative to help newsrooms faced with declining resources continue to play the watchdog role that is so vital in this time of crisis. Digital Sunlight is our code name for a new feature set that will allow citizens to help journalists cover the stimulus act and the other big stories that affect our lives and our communities by submitting tips, leads, anecdotes, questions, etc. into a global searchable database.</p>
<p>In particular, we aim to overcome what we believe is a limitation of many &#8220;citizen journalism&#8221; initiatives to date, i.e. viewing citizen journalism as an end in itself, where citizens are supposed to replace professional journalists, filling up community sites with reporting. We believe citizen journalism is part of a larger process where professional journalists still play the vital role they always have. The key is to enable dynamic and ongoing collaboration between citizens and professional journalists, where citizens can become a true practical extension of the newsroom.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all about collaboration.</p>
<p><span id="more-1250"></span>Collaboration has always been at the heart of the Publish2 vision, even before the crisis in the news industry made it clear that journalism would have to embrace the power of collaboration in order to survive and thrive in the digital age. Publish2 now has one of the <a href="http://www.publish2.com/directory/journalists">largest communities of journalists</a> practicing online journalism (i.e. <a href="http://www.publish2.com/about/what-is-link-journalism">link journalism</a>). We have also witnessed some pioneering instances of collaboration among journalists and newsrooms using Publish2, all arising from big news events, e.g. <a href="http://publishing2.com/2009/01/09/networked-link-journalism-a-revolution-quietly-begins-in-washington-state/">floods in Washington state</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/obama/chi-publish-obama-htmlpage,0,7945289.htmlstory">Obama&#8217;s inauguration</a>, the <a href="http://publishing2.com/2008/12/10/breaking-news-link-journalism-blagojevich-arrest/">Blagojevich arrest</a>.</p>
<p>With Digital Sunlight, we are realizing the full vision of a platform for collaborative journalism, which connects individual journalists, newsrooms, and citizens, and harnesses the web as a platform for enabling and distributing public service journalism.</p>
<p>We are fortunate at this inflection point to have the guidance of one of the great champions of public service journalism, <a href="http://howard.weaver.org/resume/index.html">Howard Weaver</a>. A Pulitzer Prize winner, Howard was the VP of News for McClatchy through the end of last year. Howard shares our vision that the future of journalism will combine the power of digital and collaborative technologies with the enduring qualities of professional journalism.</p>
<p>Howard has been an informal advisor since Publish2 was just a proverbial scrawl on the back of a napkin. Here&#8217;s Digital Sunlight in Howard&#8217;s own words (<a href="http://editor.blogspot.com/2009/02/how-will-smaller-news-staffs-cover.html">from his blog</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>Before long, hundreds of billions of dollars will flow out of Washington and wash across every community in the country. This stimulus spending represents an unprecedented response to an unprecedented crisis, and defines one of the biggest stories of our generation.</p>
<p>How can today&#8217;s news organizations possibly cover it adequately? Even if news staffs were growing, they&#8217;d be hard-pressed to keep up with the dozens, perhaps hundreds of projects that will affect individual communities. Even knowing where to look will be bewildering.</p>
<p>I think the new web service for journalists called <a href="http://www.publish2.com/" target="_blank">Publish2</a> can improve the coverage – and, in doing so, help journalism and the country.</p>
<p>Publish2 pioneered <a href="../2009/01/09/networked-link-journalism-a-revolution-quietly-begins-in-washington-state/" target="_blank">collaborative link journalism</a> , and it&#8217;s rapidly being adapted to go a step farther: helping professional journalists enlist the eyes and ears of the audience in covering a huge story like this. The same system that now lets news organizations share links with with readers will soon enable them to ask readers to share tips, opinions and observations about how stimulus spending is working in their area.</p>
<p>Using Publish2&#8242;s free system, individual websites can easily let users submit information about projects. Some might be whistleblowers – imagine a Citibank secretary who didn&#8217;t think the company should be buying a new jet – while others will simply have questions they think should be asked. Sites can also solicit success stories, tales of stimulus spending that&#8217;s working.</p>
<p>Reporters will be able to search a sophisticated database of all the reader submissions – for instance, zeroing in on a particular region, or a certain company, or an individual government department. The system will let them query their readers to solicit feedback and information on specific stimulus topics.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Publish2 will also provide an <a href="http://www.publish2.com/topics/stimulus">aggregated list of links</a> to all the best stimulus journalism around the country, which can be used to augment and extend individual websites.</p>
<p>New features enabling broad collaboration among journalists and citizens will be available to Publish2 users very soon, and every newsroom ought to explore the system and consider participating. To me, the effort looks like a win-win from every angle, helping individual newsrooms cover a big, sprawling story in a time of declining resources, helping enable watchdog journalism on the biggest spending spree ever, and empowering citizens to help.</p>
<p>This could be a breakthrough project in the field of &#8220;citizen journalism&#8221; – more accurately, a way to let professionals tap into the power of the crowd to help inform and invigorate their reporting.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been an informal advisor at Publish2 since the idea emerged, and have watched with interest as it&#8217;s developed. I believe it&#8217;s poised to emerge as a powerful, essential tool for journalists, and its business model lets it do so without costing a dime. (By way of disclosure, I have been asked to think about joining Pub2&#8242;s board of directors and am considering that).</p>
<p>Journalists and technologists on the Publish2 team will stand behind this project to help news organizations participate as robustly as they want. I encourage you to explore the possibilities.</p></blockquote>
<p>As to when the new Digital Sunlight functionality will be available on Publish2, we are baking as fast as we can and will have an update shortly.  In the meantime, check out our <a href="http://www.publish2.com/topics/stimulus">Stimulus Newswire</a> &#8212; simply add the stimulus tag to links saved on Publish2 to collaborate on rounding up the best coverage of the stimulus act anywhere on the web.</p>
<p>Our goal for Digital Sunlight is to enable the largest collaborative reporting effort in history, and to demonstrate that collaboration is essential to the future of journalism.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My post on the <a href="http://publishing2.com/2009/01/09/networked-link-journalism-a-revolution-quietly-begins-in-washington-state/" target="_blank">Washington state linking project</a> focused on the awesome innovation involved and on the benefits of collaborative linking in general. But the project also shows why this kind of news aggregation is so useful for a local audience.</p>
<p>The biggest danger with news aggregation is that instead of acting as a filter, it can sometimes add to readers&#8217; information overload. I read <a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/" target="_blank">Andrew Sullivan&#8217;s blog</a> as much for his links as for his original posts, but some days his link-blogging is just too prolific for me. (As <a href="http://twitter.com/howardowens/status/1145349272" target="_blank">Howard Owens put it</a>: &#8220;<span class="entry-content">To all the bloggers in my RSS reader: You post too frequently.  Stop it. Let me catch up, for a change.&#8221;)</span></p>
<p>Commenter Matthias Spielkamp worried that the Washington link project <a href="http://publishing2.com/2009/01/09/networked-link-journalism-a-revolution-quietly-begins-in-washington-state/#comment-604663" target="_blank">might have had this effect</a>: &#8220;I don’t have the time to read through 25 different stories to get a picture of the situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>But we shouldn&#8217;t mistake a long list of links for confusing overload just because it looks like overload from afar. The closer readers are to a story or event, the more they want to know about it and the less overloaded they&#8217;ll feel.</p>
<p><span id="more-1224"></span>Take a look at the headlines on the current <a href="http://www.kitsapsun.com/news/2009/jan/07/flood-watch-issued-but-kitsap-better-off-than/" target="_blank">Kitsap Sun flood widget</a>: &#8220;W. Wash. flood clean-up information&#8221;; &#8220;Maple Valley firefighters rescue residents from flooded homes&#8221;; &#8220;Flooding, for the most part, misses Federal Way&#8221;; &#8220;At least 500 Snohomish County homes flooded, officials say&#8221;; &#8220;Flooding halts Whidbey sports action.&#8221;</p>
<p>Each of those is a unique story that&#8217;s going to be very useful to someone living in that area. None of them repeats the others. Chances are, someone who lives in Maple Valley has friends or relatives in Federal Way or Whidbey. What looks like two dozen versions of the same story to Matthias or me is vital information for people who live in the flooding area.</p>
<p>Jack Lail found the same level of interest for Knoxnews.com&#8217;s <a href="http://publishing2.com/2008/11/21/link-journalism-drives-page-views-and-engagement/" target="_blank">link roundups on the Tennessee Vols</a>. To me, the roundups look like overload. But they get tons of page views, Jack noted, &#8220;because fans are passionate and can’t get enough information on their teams and games.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s kind of counterintuitive, given the emerging consensus that Matthias noted in <a href="http://publishing2.com/2009/01/09/networked-link-journalism-a-revolution-quietly-begins-in-washington-state/#comment-606761" target="_blank">another comment</a> about the importance of clean news sites that don&#8217;t overload the audience. What good human-powered local aggregation does is feed readers&#8217; deep interest in such topics without overloading them with 50 versions of the same AP story.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The discussion about journalism&#8217;s future so often focuses on Big Changes &#8212; Kill the print edition! <a href="http://www.theflip.com/" target="_blank">Flips</a> for everyone! Reinvent business models NOW! &#8212; that it&#8217;s easy to forget how simple innovation can be.</p>
<p>Sometimes all you need is a few Tweets, a bunch of links, and some like-minded pioneers.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how a quiet revolution began in Washington state Wednesday. Four journalists spontaneously launched one of the first experiments in collaborative (or networked) link journalism to cover a major local story.</p>
<p>But it gets better. Those four journalists weren&#8217;t in the same newsroom. In fact, they all work for different media companies. And here&#8217;s the best part: Some of them have never even met in person.</p>
<p><span id="more-1206"></span>&#8220;The whole thing came together on Twitter yesterday morning,&#8221; Elaine Helm, new media editor at <a href="http://heraldnet.com/" target="_blank">the Herald</a> in Everett, said in an email Thursday.</p>
<p>The story was crazy rain in western Washington: evacuations, <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2008604116_webfloods08m.html" target="_blank">flooded and closed highways</a>, avalanches, <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2008599426_webweather07m.html" target="_blank">a breached levee</a>, the whole deal. Elaine (<a href="http://twitter.com/ehelm" target="_blank">@ehelm</a> on Twitter), put a call out for local Twitterers to adopt a common hashtag for flooding coverage. Paul Balcerak (<a href="http://twitter.com/paulbalcerak" target="_blank">@paulbalcerak</a>), assistant editor of dynamic media for <a href="http://www.pnwlocalnews.com/" target="_blank">Sound Publishing</a>, suggested #waflood, which they agreed on and posted for their Twitter followers to see.</p>
<p><a href="http://publishing2.com/images/tweets.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1213" title="tweets" src="http://publishing2.com/images/tweets.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="485" /></a></p>
<p>As Paul described it in an email, Brianne Pruitt (<a href="http://twitter.com/Briannepruitt" target="_blank">@briannepruitt</a>, <a href="http://wenatcheeworld.com/" target="_blank">Wenatchee World</a> web editor) and Angela Dice (<a href="http://twitter.com/adice" target="_blank">@adice</a>, <a href="http://www.kitsapsun.com/" target="_blank">Kitsap Sun</a> web editor) picked up on the hashtag, &#8220;and it snowballed.&#8221;</p>
<p>That would have been innovation enough, but Paul went a step further: He saved links to flood coverage through <a href="http://www.publish2.com/" target="_blank">Publish2</a>, tagging each with &#8220;waflood,&#8221; and posted on Twitter that he was doing so. Soon Elaine, Angela, and Brianne were also adding links to Publish2 <a href="http://www.publish2.com/topics/waflood/" target="_blank">with a &#8220;waflood&#8221; tag</a>.</p>
<p>They then put Publish2 widgets on their news organizations&#8217; sites that displayed the links they were collaboratively gathering, greatly expanding their sites&#8217; coverage of the flooding.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.heraldnet.com/article/20090107/BLOG14/901079987" target="_blank">Herald&#8217;s link roundup</a> (which is also linked on the Herald&#8217;s homepage);</p>
<p><a href="http://publishing2.com/images/heraldnet-flood-widget.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1209" title="heraldnet-flood-widget" src="http://publishing2.com/images/heraldnet-flood-widget-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.kitsapsun.com/news/2009/jan/07/flood-watch-issued-but-kitsap-better-off-than/" target="_blank">Kitsap Sun&#8217;s</a> (inset in a story at left, linked on the homepage at right, and on this <a href="http://www.kitsapsun.com/northwest-news-picks/">full page of links</a>);</p>
<p><a href="http://publishing2.com/images/kitsap-sun-flood-homepage.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1214" style="float:right;" title="kitsap-sun-flood-homepage" src="http://publishing2.com/images/kitsap-sun-flood-homepage-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a><a href="http://publishing2.com/images/kitsap-sun-flood-widget.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1210" title="kitsap-sun-flood-widget" src="http://publishing2.com/images/kitsap-sun-flood-widget-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://wenatcheeworld.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090108/NEWS03/701089914/1001" target="_blank">Wenatchee World&#8217;s</a> (see inset box at left);</p>
<p><a href="http://publishing2.com/images/wenatchee-world-flood-widget.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1212" title="wenatchee-world-flood-widget" src="http://publishing2.com/images/wenatchee-world-flood-widget-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>and the one at <a href="http://www.pnwlocalnews.com/news/37229194.html" target="_blank">Sound Publishing&#8217;s pnwlocalnews.com</a> (see &#8220;Washington state flooding&#8221; at the bottom).</p>
<p><a href="http://publishing2.com/images/pnwlocalnews-flood-widget.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1211" title="pnwlocalnews-flood-widget" src="http://publishing2.com/images/pnwlocalnews-flood-widget-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>Voila &#8212; instant <a href="http://publishing2.com/2008/10/07/the-new-ap/" target="_blank">collaborative link newswire</a>!</p>
<h3><strong>The collaborative spirit of journalism&#8217;s future</strong></h3>
<p>This collaboration is remarkable in all kinds of ways.</p>
<p>First, you can tell by the Twitter timestamps how quickly everything came together. Second, with a link newswire fed by multiple news organizations, there&#8217;s a danger that everyone might add only their own stories to the mix. But this group added outside sources as well (including the News Tribune, Seattle Post-Intelligencer, the Seattle Times, Yakima Herald-Republic, the Daily Record, and more). Third, all four independently and instantly &#8220;got&#8221; what the others were doing, which shows how much the ideas of collaboration and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en-us&amp;q=link+journalism&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">link journalism</a> (and even <a href="http://twitter.com/greenergrad/status/1102960247" target="_blank">the term itself</a>) have spread.</p>
<p>Lastly, did I mention the four journalists work for different media companies? The Herald is owned by the Washington Post Co., Kitsap Sun by Scripps, Sound Publishing by Black Press (of Victoria, B.C.), and Wenatchee World is independent/family-owned. Paul hasn&#8217;t met Angela or Brianne in person, and has met Elaine briefly once. Yet none of that was an obstacle.</p>
<p>I asked Angela in an email whether she knew the others in non-Twitter life. Here&#8217;s her wonderful answer:</p>
<blockquote><p>I used to work with Elaine at the Sun and talk to her regularly, and she’s one of the reasons I joined Twitter. While I’d never done any project with Brianne before, she had made it a point to visit other papers around the region and introduce herself when she became the Wenatchee World web editor, which is how I started following her on Twitter. I met Seth Long [Sound Publishing's new media director] on Twitter, which is how I met Paul, neither of whom I&#8217;ve met in person. They both, however, work with a former co-worker and friend of mine. It’s a small, small online journalism world in Western Washington.</p></blockquote>
<p>How refreshing is that? Forget walled gardens &#8212; this is the spirit of journalism&#8217;s future.</p>
<p><span id=":759" dir="ltr">In some ways the networked linking process is an extension of how newsrooms collaborate with traditional wire services</span>, but I think the Washington project is more than that. Papers using a traditional wire service aren&#8217;t really collaborating. They&#8217;re primarily trying to a) extend the reach of their stories, and b) get access to material they can&#8217;t afford to produce on their own.</p>
<p>The dynamic on display Wednesday, and the relationships Angela described in the quote above that allowed for this collaboration, seem more organic &#8212; a mental leap forward. They even emphasized the collaboration in the widget descriptions: <a href="http://www.kitsapsun.com/northwest-news-picks/" target="_blank">Kitsap Sun&#8217;s</a> says &#8220;<span id=":1zc" dir="ltr">Stories are chosen by news reporters and editors from Washington news organizations,&#8221; while <a href="http://www.heraldnet.com/article/20090107/BLOG14/901079987" target="_blank">the Herald&#8217;s</a> says &#8220;</span><span id=":1zc" dir="ltr">Below are news stories that journalists around the state have selected to post using a service called Publish2.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>I asked Seth Long (<a href="http://twitter.com/greenergrad" target="_blank">@greenergrad</a>) about a similar project he and Angela had worked on in December to  <a href="http://www.pnwlocalnews.com/news/36478584.html" target="_blank"> round up links to snowstorm coverage</a>. (For future Wikipedia articles on link journalism: To my knowledge, theirs was the first example of networked link journalism across media companies.)</p>
<p>He noted that &#8220;Her newspaper is a direct competitor with a group of our community weeklies.&#8221; In the old world, that would have made collaboration a non-starter. But today readers rightly come first. As Seth said, &#8220;My perspective is that our job is to serve our communities as best we can.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Innovation that&#8217;s easy, popular, and cheap</h3>
<p>The Washington link projects should serve as models for the entire news industry. They show that collaborative linking draws readers, is easy, and costs nothing more than time (and not even much of that).</p>
<p>Seth said the December snowstorm link roundup was on the homepage for three or four days &#8212; but it was <strong>the site&#8217;s most-trafficked story for the entire month</strong>. (This tracks with Knoxnews.com&#8217;s success with a <a href="http://publishing2.com/2008/11/21/link-journalism-drives-page-views-and-engagement/" target="_blank">popular football link roundup</a>.)</p>
<p>Angela described some of the other benefits of collaborative linking:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think it&#8217;s especially useful in situations like these, where events affect a large region. I can also see it being used as a way to track things like state government news, or any broad-reaching issue that your readers will be talking about.</p>
<p>Having a group of people adding the links just makes your job that much easier. As both a reader and a web editor, I can keep updated on what&#8217;s happening on a particular topic without opening and slogging through a dozen web sites.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the power of collaborative news networks. <span id=":1ng" dir="ltr">By forming a network, newsrooms can discover not just a greater volume of news, but a greater volume of <strong>relevant, high-quality news</strong> than one person, one newsroom, or one wire service could alone. </span></p>
<p><span id=":1ng" dir="ltr">Compare the Washington group&#8217;s <a href="http://www.publish2.com/topics/waflood/" target="_blank">great waflood link roundup</a> to a Google News <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=&amp;q=washington+flood&amp;btnG=Search+News" target="_blank">search for &#8220;Washington flood&#8221;</a> &#8212; I know which one I&#8217;d rather have as a resource if I lived in that area.<br />
</span></p>
<p>Doing this isn&#8217;t complicated. In an email, Brianne described the extent of her planning: &#8220;I follow the others on Twitter, and they had started a hashtag, #waflood, and then mentioned using the same tag for publish2 links.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it! Any group of news organizations can do this, even if they&#8217;re not Twitter-friends.</p>
<p>A good way to start is to set up a Publish2 newsgroup and invite other journalists (as Angela did with a <a href="http://www.publish2.com/newsgroups/northwest-news/" target="_blank">Northwest News newsgroup</a> in December). Collaboratively save links about a couple of non-breaking-news subjects to get a feel for it, and try publishing feeds of those links. Then when a big story breaks, it&#8217;s a simple matter of choosing a common tag and alerting everyone in the newsgroup.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get hung up on worries about sinking a lot of time or money into this. As Angela said, &#8220;There&#8217;s a perception that with some tools, it&#8217;s a lot of extra work, but &#8212; I&#8217;m specifically talking about the Publish2 model &#8212; when you realize how little time it really takes to bookmark a page you&#8217;re already reading, it&#8217;s a wonder you weren&#8217;t doing it before.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for money, when the technology is free all you need to invest in is smart journalists. Here&#8217;s what Paul had to say Wednesday:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think it&#8217;s worth pointing out that everything we did today cost us $0.</p></blockquote>
<p>That, too, is the spirit of journalism&#8217;s future. I can&#8217;t wait to see what this innovative crew cooks up next in that spirit &#8212; and who will be the first to follow their lead.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Entering 2009, the future of media is undoubtedly a quandary, with no end of head-scratching across the industry. As with everything these days, it seems that it all comes down to radically changing economics. There are way too many conversations about the future of media, news, journalism, etc. going on out there that don&#8217;t reference economics, so I&#8217;m going to kick off the year with two personal anecdotes that illustrate the problem of media economics.</p>
<p>Last weekend, my wife and I wanted to watch <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0416508/">Becoming Jane</a>, because we&#8217;ve been on a Jane Austin kick. We watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0414387/">Pride &amp; Prejudice</a> the night before (highly recommended). We subscribe to Netflix DVDs, but we hadn&#8217;t ordered the movie, and we didn&#8217;t feel like waiting. I went to iTunes, and it was available for purchase for $15, but not for renting (for $3 or $4). Amazon, same deal, not on their video on demand service, just the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Jane-Philip-Culhane/dp/B000ZIZ0RA">DVD for $15</a>. I checked out <a href="http://www.netflix.com/NetflixReadyDevices?lnkce=nrd-o&amp;trkid=425738&amp;lnkctr=nrd-o-n">Neflix&#8217;s Video on Demand</a> offering and found that we don&#8217;t have the <a href="http://www.netflix.com/NetflixReadyDevicesList?lnkce=nrd-l&amp;trkid=425738&amp;lnkctr=nrd-l-n">right hardware</a> (nor do we have the required &#8220;unlimited&#8221; subscription). Hulu, well, they&#8217;re making progress on movies, but it&#8217;s mostly <a href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/50584/muppets-from-space">old stuff</a>. Video store &#8212; the Hollywood video near us is an empty shell &#8212; and I can&#8217;t remember the last time we got into a car to rent a movie.</p>
<p>So here we were, ready to spend $4 even $5 dollars on content, and nobody would take our money. Seriously.</p>
<p>So that $5 stayed in my walled. No sale. No revenue. Nothing. We didn&#8217;t end up watching a movie.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another story.</p>
<p><span id="more-1205"></span>Over the holiday, we helped some relatives post a listing for basement apartment on Craisglist. They had already listed the apartment in the newspaper, but they responses had been entirely from older people &#8212; 70s and even 80s. They had been looking for a young professional (it&#8217;s a steep staircase down to the apartment). And the responses had been coming in slowly. The apartment remained unrented.</p>
<p>We posted the apartment listing on Craigslist, and over the next few days they were flooded by phone calls, mostly people in their 20s. In less than a week they had rented the apartment to a public school teacher who had been living at home and was looking for her first place.</p>
<p>So they were able to achieve for free on Craigslist what they couldn&#8217;t achieve by spending money in the newspaper.</p>
<p>To me, these two incidents represent media value equations that have radically changed. It seems that most media companies still haven&#8217;t figured out how to adapt to or even understand the changes to the fundamental exchange of value in media.</p>
<p>Some of that stems from a failure to understand legacy media economics.</p>
<p>People ask why no one wants to pay for news anymore, referencing the decline in newspaper circulation, when in fact that misrepresents the value equation. People were paying for newsPAPERS, which contained a lot more than news, and they were also paying for newspaper delivery, which is a service.</p>
<p>For all those people searching for apartments on Craigslist, the value equation for their local newspaper has fundamentally changed. They may still value local news, but some of the highly valuable information that used to ride along with the news has been removed, which changes the equation.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that no one wants to pay for music or movies, it&#8217;s that increasingly we want to pay for content when, where, and however we want. We&#8217;re willing to pay for the convenience of video on demand, but the service isn&#8217;t always being offered. Digital technology has put content producers in the services business, but they don&#8217;t yet fully understand that value exchange.</p>
<p>New business models for media require entirely new exchanges of value &#8212; it&#8217;s not about finding new ways to balance the old equation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With all the debate over the <a href="http://news.google.com/news?client=safari&amp;rls=en-us&amp;q=future%20of%20newspapers&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;um=1&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wn">future of newspapers</a>, here&#8217;s a question I haven&#8217;t heard anybody ask (much less answer): If a metropolitan newspaper suddenly ceased to publish, leaving the city with no newspaper, what would happen to all of that newspaper&#8217;s ad dollars?</p>
<p>Most newspaper companies&#8217; strategy right now is based on the assumption that you can&#8217;t shut down the print newspaper because it brings in 90% of the revenue, and you couldn&#8217;t possibly support the same news gathering operation with the 10% revenue slice that goes to the website. (<a href="http://publishing2.com/2007/07/17/newspaper-online-vs-print-ad-revenue-the-10-problem/">The 10% problem</a>)</p>
<p>There&#8217;s just one problem with this assumption. All of the ad dollars that the print newspaper gets are, by definition, ad dollars that the newspaper&#8217;s website does NOT get.</p>
<p><span id="more-1202"></span>Think about that for a second. Newspapers know that they are competing with their websites for ad dollars. But newspapers are also essentially competing with their websites for survival.</p>
<p>So what WOULD happen to those millions of dollars in advertising if there were no longer a print newspaper to collect them? </p>
<p>Some of it would simply vaporize due to one of the following factors: </p>
<ul>
<li>Craigslist, Kijiji, or other free classified websites</li>
<li>Businesses stop advertising altogether (never saw ROI)</li>
<li>Businesses shut down entirely (e.g. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/15/business/15retail.html">retailers</a>)</li>
<li>Prolonged cyclical downturn (e.g. real estate)</li>
</ul>
<p>But what would happen to the rest of it, to the ad dollars that businesses still want to spend?</p>
<p>Who would compete for those ad dollars? How much pricing power would they have with the old monopoly gone?  How would the value propositions and ROI (perceived or real) differ from that of newspaper advertising (e.g. search advertising vs. display advertising vs. new ad models). How would advertisers perceive these alternatives to print advertising?</p>
<p>Most importantly for newspapers, what share of these suddenly liberated ad dollars could their news brand (which used to be the name on the advertisers&#8217; checks) capture with an online-only reincarnation, now that the brand was no longer competing with itself? (I&#8217;m following <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hvi1aIzfx80Js6B648IEnrZ5ipOQD9543H9O0">ASNE&#8217;s lead</a> in calling it a news brand instead of a newspaper brand.) What kind of newsroom and journalism could those &#8220;reclaimed&#8221; ad dollars support?</p>
<p>If I were a newspaper executive, I would cancel all meetings, clear off my desk, get out a really sharp pencil, and start trying to answer these questions. You can be sure that many other companies are already working on figuring out the answers.</p>
<p>To be clear, I&#8217;m not saying that newspapers should shut down the print product. I&#8217;m saying that newspapers should make sure they think through what would actually happen to all that advertising revenue if they were forced to stop publishing in print (which increasingly looks like a real possibility for some newspapers). Figuring this out could, in some cases, make the difference between surviving in some form (or even thriving) and ceasing to exist.</p>
<p>P.S. Regarding circulation revenue, those dollars will likely vaporize if the newspaper stops publishing in print. Why pay for distribution when its free? (Yeah, newspaper subscriptions were mostly for the distribution, not for the content. Everyone understands printing the newspaper and delivering it to your door is costly. And everyone knows it&#8217;s not the case with bits. Which is not to say readers don&#8217;t value the content, but there&#8217;s a big difference between paying for news and paying for the delivered bundle of news and information that is a newspaper.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So you&#8217;ve got a big breaking story right in your backyard, e.g. the governor gets arrested for trying to sell the U.S. Senate seat vacated by the President Elect. Your newsroom is on the case, but the story is still developing. There are national ramifications, so reporting goes beyond the local angle. How do you round out your front page coverage, add to your dynamic updates, and reinforce to readers that you are THE destination for this story?</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re the <a href="http://chicagotribune.com">Chicago Tribune</a>, you create a link journalism feature that dynamically tracks what &#8220;<a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-blagojevich-arrested-newsgroup,0,3166966.story">what others are saying</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p><a href="http://publishing2.com/images/chicago-tribune-on-the-web-homepage.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1196" title="chicago-tribune-on-the-web-homepage" src="http://publishing2.com/images/chicago-tribune-on-the-web-homepage.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="555" /></a></p>
<p><span id="more-1195"></span>You create a <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-blagojevich-arrested-newsgroup,0,3166966.story">continuously updating news aggregation</a> page (using a <a href="http://www.publish2.com">Publish2</a> widget) and you get a team of producers and editors to collaborate on gathering links (using a <a href="http://www.publish2.com/newsgroups/blagojevich-arrest/">Publish2 newsgroup</a>).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-blagojevich-arrested-newsgroup,0,3166966.story"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1197" title="chicago-tribune-blagojevich-arrest" src="http://publishing2.com/images/chicago-tribune-blagojevich-arrest.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="618" /></a></p>
<p>Then, as everyone reacts to the story, you promote reactions from &#8220;Other sites, other voices&#8221; alongside reader reactions.</p>
<p><a href="http://publishing2.com/images/chicago-tribune-homepage-arrest.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1198" title="chicago-tribune-homepage-arrest" src="http://publishing2.com/images/chicago-tribune-homepage-arrest.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="575" /></a></p>
<p>And while algorithms deliver commodity aggregation from limited sources, your editors apply human judgment to create a unique mix from local sources (including your rivals!), national sources, blogs, social media, and even humor (because only humans know when a scandal is so over the top that it&#8217;s laughable).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-blagojevich-arrested-newsgroup,0,3166966.story"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1199" title="chicago-tribune-blago-later" src="http://publishing2.com/images/chicago-tribune-blago-later.jpg" alt="" width="499" height="562" /></a></p>
<p>And what if you&#8217;re in a nearby city in a neighboring state? Well, not to be outdone, you link to &#8220;<a href="http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/illinoisnews/story/57FB9AFCF05EBB018625751A005759B2?OpenDocument">what bloggers are saying</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://publishing2.com/images/stltoday-homepage-bloggers-saying.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1200" title="stltoday-homepage-bloggers-saying" src="http://publishing2.com/images/stltoday-homepage-bloggers-saying.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="383" /></a></p>
<p>You hand pick from the sea of blog coverage the most interesting perspectives, bloggers shining the spotlight on key issues. You again distinguish your link journalism from commodity algorithm-driven news aggregation by introducing readers to hugely interesting sites like <a href="http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/12/blagojevich-fallout.html">FiveThirtyEight</a>. And you dynamically update with new links across the day (using a <a href="http://www.publish2.com">Publish2</a> widget).</p>
<p><a href="http://publishing2.com/images/stltoday-bloggers-are-saying.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1201" title="stltoday-bloggers-are-saying" src="http://publishing2.com/images/stltoday-bloggers-are-saying.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="613" /></a></p>
<p>All in all, you feel contented that the news roundup was quick and easy to set up with a free service, easy to update dynamically, and provided a solid complement to your original reporting. You feel contented that you served well your readers who were hungry to read about a mind-blowing scandal, and kept them from having to go to an aggregation site for a range of coverage and views.</p>
<p>You can also take satisfaction in having <a href="http://apps.wbez.org/blog/?p=791">inspired others to try their hand at link journalism</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Like I said in my last post, Gov. Blagojevich’s arrest (and <a onclick="urchinTracker('/outgoing/www.chicagobreakingnews.com/2008/12/gov-blagojevich-court-hearing.html?referer=');" href="http://www.chicagobreakingnews.com/2008/12/gov-blagojevich-court-hearing.html" target="_blank">apparent release</a>) is burning up newsrooms across the country today. I was pretty impressed by the Tribune’s page aggregating Blago coverage, so I asked <a onclick="urchinTracker('/outgoing/twitter.com/coloneltribune?referer=');" href="http://twitter.com/coloneltribune" target="_blank">@ColonelTribune</a> how they did it and was introduced to the wonderful world of <a onclick="urchinTracker('/outgoing/www.publish2.com/?referer=');" href="http://www.publish2.com/" target="_blank">Publish2.com</a>. It’s kind of like Digg, but only for journalists. And I was able to make this really cool widget on it…</p></blockquote>
<p>Either that or you ask yourself&#8230; why aren&#8217;t we doing breaking news link journalism?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy. The <a href="http://www.publish2.com/register">technology is free</a>. And it makes your site a more vital destination for breaking news.</p>
<p>Seriously, why aren&#8217;t you doing it?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I want to further explore the idea of <a href="http://publishing2.com/2008/12/08/why-not-writing-a-story-is-innovation/" target="_blank">&#8220;scrapbook news&#8221;</a> as a way of reframing the crowdsourcing/citizen journalism discussion.</p>
<p>One reason mainstream news organizations haven&#8217;t embraced the concepts may be that the spirit (if not the letter) of the cit-j discussion tends to focus on the people involved rather than the news being covered. That is, the tonal takeaway is often something like &#8220;Who needs professional journalists? Throw the useless bums out of their tower!&#8221;</p>
<p>These ideas might get a better reception if the discussion instead focused on which kinds of news are best suited to coverage by people outside the newsroom.</p>
<p><span id="more-1194"></span>Scrapbook news offers an interesting example. Matt Waite wrote a <a href="http://publishing2.com/2008/12/08/why-not-writing-a-story-is-innovation/#comment-587933" target="_blank">great comment</a> about this kind of news on my previous post:</p>
<blockquote><p>When I was a kid — the 80s — when I or a group I was part of did something scrapbook worthy, my mom would type up a little announcement about it and bring it to the local twice weekly. Next edition, there it was, almost unchanged. Scrapbooking would ensue. Far from an experiment in crowdsourcing, this is the way it’s done in small towns across the country. The only experiment is how to scale it from a community of 6,000 to 60,000 to 600,000.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the past, my cynical response to news items like that would have been &#8220;What&#8217;s this doing here?!? It&#8217;s not news!!&#8221; But to many people, it <em>is</em> news. For most readers, seeing their name in the paper is worth more years of goodwill and subscriptions than any blockbuster investigative story.</p>
<p>A more appropriate response (for cynics and non-cynics alike) would be: &#8220;Why are we spending time on this when readers could do just as good a job, and in doing so become more engaged with the paper?&#8221;</p>
<p>The truth is, scrapbook news written by journalists is effectively the same as scrapbook news submitted by the would-be scrapbookers. If the story is &#8220;Megan won the 4-H award at the fair,&#8221; how much of a difference does it make to have a journalist write the story rather than Megan&#8217;s mom? (Though you&#8217;d probably still want some minimal level of editing so every item didn&#8217;t say &#8220;Goooo, Megan!&#8221; Or maybe that would be ok too.)</p>
<p>The key would be to acknowledge that while scrapbook news is news, certain kinds of news might not carry the same burden of expertise, professionalism, polish or &#8220;objectivity&#8221; (if you believe in that sort of thing) as city council coverage might.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, even some city council coverage could fall under this category. As more governing bodies stream their meetings online and provide downloadable transcripts and video, why couldn’t gadflies and other interested people cover some meetings, with full-time journalists focusing on follow-up reporting? (For a contrary view, see Daniel Victor&#8217;s excellent <a href="http://bydanielvictor.com/2008/12/02/easy-immediate-responsible-deployments-of-crowdsourcing/" target="_blank">series of posts on crowdsourcing</a>.)</p>
<p>Similarly &#8212; though on a subject of less civic importance &#8212; why couldn’t sports fans provide some game coverage? Are readers really that much better served by a journalist giving a play-by-play rundown of a game that anyone with the right satellite-TV package can see, topped off with a handful of clichéd quotes?</p>
<p>I’m not suggesting sports reporters never do serious reporting. But fans are so immersed and educated in sports minutiae that they could point out key plays and strategies just as well as a journalist can, which would free up sports reporters for more non-game reporting. And the world would be a much better place if there were fewer quotes about wanting it the most, winning it in the trenches, doing what we came to do which was to win, just taking it one day at a time.</p>
<p>Letting outsiders cover some of these topics doesn&#8217;t have to mean abandoning editorial standards. Newsrooms could require that any contributors attend a session about journalism and editorial standards. Once it&#8217;s contributors&#8217; name on the story and readers start lobbing criticism at them, they&#8217;ll realize that adhering to those standards is the best defense.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s review: Reader-contributors get as excited about seeing their names in the paper as li’l Matt Waite’s mom was back in the day. Strained newsrooms are relieved of some of their burden without stinting on certain coverage. Journalists stop hearing that Random Person #72 could do their job better, because the journos now have more time to focus on the reporting that no random person could do.</p>
<p>What newsroom would say no to that deal?</p>
<p>UPDATE: This is linked via trackback in the comments, but be sure to read John Zhu&#8217;s tour de force <a href="http://www.john-zhu.com/blog/2008/12/09/thoughts-on-scrapbook-news/" target="_blank">response post</a>. He raises lots of good questions. I&#8217;ll try to respond once I&#8217;ve had a chance to process all of it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Discussions about journalism innovation usually focus on technology: Twitter, RSS, Flash, Django, data visualization, and all the other cool stuff that&#8217;s making online news so rich.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s an equally important conceptual aspect of journalism innovation. Newsrooms have to <a href="http://korrvalues.com/2008/02/17/how-to-fix-journalism-i-what-is-news/" target="_blank">rethink the kind of stories</a> they cover and <a href="http://blog.publish2.com/2008/09/09/how-links-can-solve-newspapers-broccoli-problem-aka-the-nude-britney-ipod-conundrum/" target="_blank">the way they tell those stories</a>, or all the new technologies could be wasted on news that readers don&#8217;t find relevant or interesting.</p>
<p>To do this, they have to practice innovation-by-omission. That is, they need to stop writing stories that don&#8217;t deserve to be written.</p>
<p><span id="more-1174"></span></p>
<p>Newsrooms no longer have the luxury of wasting resources on non-stories &#8212; on &#8220;<a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/2008/11/04/the-journalism-of-filling-space-and-time/" target="_blank">the journalism of filling space and time</a>,&#8221; as Jeff Jarvis put it. They no longer have the luxury, in an information-overload world, of wasting readers&#8217; time with non-stories or information readers already know. Readers will simply go somewhere else.</p>
<p>Jarvis offers a mental checklist for journalists to consider before publishing a possible non-story:</p>
<blockquote><p>if you can’t imagine anyone linking to your coverage — if you can’t imagine anyone saying “this was new,” “this is good,” “this was valuable,” “go here for more,” “I didn’t know this,” or “you should know this” — then chances are, it’s not worth saying and in the <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/2008/07/28/the-imperatives-of-the-link-economy/">link economy</a> it won’t get audience, and so it’s not worth making.</p></blockquote>
<p>Filler news can take many forms. Jarvis singles out reporting on election and post-holiday-shopping days. John McIntyre flags another persistent form of filler &#8212; stories based on dubious surveys &#8212; in <a href="http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/news/mcintyre/blog/2008/12/repeat_we_do_not_have_to_run_dumb_surveys.html" target="_blank">this post</a>. Jack Shafer never tires of exposing <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2201764/" target="_blank">bogus</a> <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2195763/" target="_blank">trend</a> <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2187384/" target="_blank">pieces</a>.</p>
<p>I would add: many stories based on (or directly lifted from) press releases; one-sentence news like stock market updates, shuttle takeoffs, and incremental updates of previous stories; many politics-as-process stories. Even &#8220;important&#8221; news can become filler. Crime briefs become monotonous after so many days; the fifth front-page story on the Russia-Georgia conflict isn&#8217;t likely to resonate.</p>
<p>Most of these story approaches are so ingrained that it&#8217;ll take conscious effort to stop and come up with more effective alternatives. But it can be done.</p>
<p>My favorite recent example of innovation-by-omission is a <a href="http://bydanielvictor.com/2008/08/11/non-story-then-dont-write-it/" target="_blank">blog post</a> by Daniel Victor, a reporter at The Patriot-News of Harrisburg, Pa. Back in August, Victor was assigned to cover a campaign &#8220;event&#8221; that the state Democratic Party had touted in a press release: &#8220;local residents would &#8216;welcome John McCain to Harrisburg by unveiling a new video called ‘Jobs’ at a press event.&#8217; ”</p>
<p>Victor discovered &#8212; surprise! &#8212; that the event was a news-free attempt to manufacture free publicity for the campaign. (His <a href="http://bydanielvictor.com/2008/08/11/non-story-then-dont-write-it/" target="_blank">must-read post</a> recounts the details of this discovery.) So he told his editor there was no story. Here&#8217;s how Victor describes the &#8220;newsroom tango&#8221; that followed:</p>
<blockquote><p>I argued that there was no story, editor argues it’s worth a short story. I write a short story focusing on the similarities with the DNC news release, and the fact the event was pitched to media as an unveiling but really wasn’t at all. Editor quickly wonders if it shouldn’t be recast as a straight “Dems respond to Mccain” story. I argue phony news events don’t deserve real news coverage. Editor finally sees it my way, the story is spiked, and you won’t read about it in my newspaper.</p>
<p>Thank goodness for that. We in the media can do our part to actually aid the discussion by checking these events out, then promptly ignoring them when they turn out to be duds.</p>
<p>Just because local politicians are speaking, and just because a reporter spent an hour listening to them speak, doesn’t mean we need to report on it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s impossible to know if a story is worthwhile without doing some digging, as Victor did. The definition of &#8220;filler&#8221; will vary from newsroom to newsroom; my idea of filler could be another person&#8217;s scrapbook keepsake. What&#8217;s important is that newsrooms at least have this discussion.</p>
<p>Once newsrooms better define their idea of filler, it&#8217;ll be easier to stop those stories before they start. It&#8217;ll also make it easier to come up with better ways of treating certain subjects.</p>
<p>For example, &#8220;scrapbook news&#8221; &#8212; county fairs, local events, awards &#8212; could be a place to start experimenting with <a href="http://bydanielvictor.com/2008/12/01/crowdsourcing-can-lead-newspapers-through-buyout-blues/" target="_blank">crowdsourcing</a>. National or world news that has become filler because of the nature of wire coverage could be <a href="http://blog.publish2.com/2008/09/09/how-links-can-solve-newspapers-broccoli-problem-aka-the-nude-britney-ipod-conundrum/" target="_blank">made relevant through linking</a>. Local political coverage could focus more on how policies will affect readers and less on news-free campaign events. And crime coverage could become more data-driven and be integrated &#8220;<span class="black">into a health &amp; safety site, because violence is a public health issue,&#8221; as <a href="http://rejournalism.wordpress.com/2008/11/10/inch-wide-mile-deep/#more-132" target="_blank">Jane Stevens suggests</a>.<br />
</span></p>
<p>There are many things newsrooms need to do differently to survive the coming years. But one of the foundational changes they must make is to listen to Daniel Victor. Sometimes there&#8217;s just no story.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the text of Daniel&#8217;s entry:<br />
<span id="more-1191"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>There are three important themes I&#8217;d like to convey with my response, if they aren&#8217;t already apparent in the video. I consider myself a &#8220;journalist of the future&#8221; (with moon boots and everything) because, even though I&#8217;m still a student, I focus on these principles.</p>
<p>First: innovation. Those who come before me were fortunate or unfortunate (depending on how you look at it) in that they were stuck with limited tools with which to be a journalist. Today, we&#8217;ve got a growing arsenal of technology to tell the important stories with, let it be livestreaming on Qik, microblogging with Twitter, or practicing link journalism with Facebook. Contrary to the popular paradigm that we&#8217;ll settle on one format, this is just the beginning of tool fragmentation. By playing and experimenting with the tools, I position myself to take advantage of what they offer.</p>
<p>Second: the untold stories. Using a combination of emerging tools and traditional formats, my goal is to cover the under reported, most troubling issues we face as a globally connected society. Examples include water access exploitation in India, deforestation and the climate in Haiti, and homelessness in the big cities of Latin America. Being a journalist of the future means using the tools to expand your capacity to tell the word&#8217;s most important stories.</p>
<p>Third: collaboration. I began this fall as the Online Editor for the Oregon Daily Emerald wanting to push the publication to innovate with technology. Given the limited resources at hand, I realised that the only way I could achieve anything significant would be to work collaboratively with my peers across the nation. From that vision, CoPress (http://www.copress.org/) was formed. Contributing to the network is an increasingly successful method of innovation.</p>
<p>Onward and forward. Let&#8217;s use these strategies to grow our abilities to be journalists and provide the information needed to create a better world.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.publish2.com/contest/entry.php?id=16">Go rate Daniel&#8217;s entry</a> and show your support. If you don&#8217;t want to enter the contest, you can be part of the future of journalism by voting.</p>
<p>Full disclosure: Daniel is an intern with Publish2, so he&#8217;s not qualified to win the prize of a job with Publish2. But he is qualified to get a whole lot of attention and praise for having an fantastic vision of the future of journalism. That&#8217;s purpose of this contest. You can post an entry to get attention from other companies looking for journalists who can help them evolve into the future (many of whom read this blog and use <a href="http://www.publish2.com">Publish2</a>).</p>
<p>To all you media execs and editors reading this, we best make sure that Daniel ends up with a sweet job when he graduates. (Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.danielbachhuber.com/">Daniel&#8217;s blog</a>.)</p>
<p>The future of journalism and news depends on the jobs that we do have being in the hands of journalists like Daniel.</p>
<p>So who&#8217;s next to be in the spotlight? We&#8217;ve heard from a journalism student. How about a veteran journalist?</p>
<p>The future of journalism is going to require that journalists know how to promote themselves and their work. This is a great way to learn. Don&#8217;t aim for high production values. Be earnest. Be creative. Be brave.</p>
<p>Want to promote yourself outside of the contest? Get a <a href="http://publish2.com">Publish2 profile</a> and link to your best work. Your profile will rank high for your name in search (especially if you don&#8217;t have a blog or your own site).</p>

<p>To enter the contest, you can submit a video, a slide show, or a written statement (or all three) about why you believe you are the future of journalism.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am the future of journalism because&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>Journalism right now needs to focus positively on the future.  That&#8217;s what Publish2 is all about.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.govolsxtra.com/news/2008/nov/11/after-phil-fulmer-ut-coach-search-sightings/">article page on GoVolXtra</a>, Knoxnews.com&#8217;s sports vertical site for the Tennessee Vols, that accounted for 6% of ALL Knoxnews and GoVolXtra article page views for the last two weeks, and as much as 14% of all article page views one of the days since it was first published. The page has consistently generated about twice as many page views as the next most visited page. And the article has racked up nearly 300 comments, becoming a nexus for discussion and debate on the hot topic that it covers &#8212; who will replace University of Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s notable about this article is that it is almost entirely LINKS:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re out to give GoVolsXtra readers the latest in coach sightings right up until the press conference to announce the next head coach of the Volunteers no matter who has the story. Check this list often; we&#8217;ll be adding to it.</p></blockquote>
<p><span id="more-1185"></span>And check back often they have.</p>
<p>Everyday the article is updated with a fresh roundup of links (saved on <a href="http://www.publish2.com">Publish2</a>) to coverage of the search for a new coach, including links sent in by readers:</p>
<p><a href="http://publishing2.com/images/coach-fulmer-search-links.jpg"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1187" title="coach-fulmer-search-links" src="http://publishing2.com/images/coach-fulmer-search-links.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="522" /></a></p>
<p>And everyday, fans keep coming back for more.</p>
<p>So you&#8217;ve got consistent engagement. You&#8217;ve got an article that consistently generates more page views than any other on the site.</p>
<p>What more could you ask for?</p>
<p>As Jack Lail put it in his <a href="http://publishing2.com/images/apme-fall2008.pdf">article on Link Journalism in the latest APME News</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Why this works with sports is because fans are passionate and can&#8217;t get enough information on their teams and games. And there is plenty of external coverage from other media, some thousands of miles away, to local bloggers looking to build up their audience.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s perhaps the most important lesson about the success of this effort at link journalism &#8212; it didn&#8217;t happen over night.</p>
<p>Link-driven coverage roundup articles have been <a href="http://publishing2.com/2008/09/22/link-journalism-in-action-vols-game-coverage-roundup-most-viewed-and-commented-on-govolsxtracom/">appearing on GoVolsXtra for months</a>, and readers have learned to like them. They&#8217;ve come to see GoVolsXtra not just as a source for Knox News Sentinel&#8217;s own original reporting on the Tennessee Vols, but for ALL the best reporting and commentary on the Vols.</p>
<p>Most news sites don&#8217;t do aggregation, they don&#8217;t help their readers find the best content on the topics that interest them. So when they start doing so, it may take readers a while to discover this new dimension of news value.</p>
<p>But once they do, there&#8217;s a good chance that they are going to love it. Just like <a href="http://publishing2.com/2008/09/15/drudge-report-news-site-that-sends-readers-away-with-links-has-highest-engagement/">web users have been deeply engaged with news aggregation for years</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to make an investment in growing your page views, audience, and engagement through <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/13/business/media/13reach.html?fta=y">link journalism</a>, NOW is the time to start.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Forget the bailout. I have a great new business model for Detroit automakers. Sell Toyotas and Hondas. Detroit already has the dealer networks. There&#8217;s great demand for Japanese cars. In fact, Detroit could retool all of their manufacturing plants to make Toyotas and Hondas.</p>
<p>That proposal is similar to one put forth for newspaper companies by API&#8217;s Newspaper Next project. <a href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2008/11/should-newspapers-become-online-ad-brokers-for-local-businesses325.html">Says managing director Stephen Gray</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;[Newspapers] should become the leading local Internet ad agency, which goes against ancient newspaper instinct of not ever helping anyone who is your competitor,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But the fact is that audiences have split in a million directions, so here we are in a local market and our job is to help businesses in our local market succeed. If that means we are placing ads on Google and Facebook for local businesses, so what? That&#8217;s what it takes to succeed and ad agencies have been making a living off doing that for some time.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s a actually not a bad idea (and I&#8217;ve seen some newspapers do it successfully). Except it seems to be tantamount to recommending that newspapers get out of the newspaper business. And if they become ad agencies, then newspapers really aren&#8217;t newspapers anymore, are they? And then there isn&#8217;t really a need for all that expensive journalism anymore, is there?</p>
<p><span id="more-1184"></span>This is the problem with the idea of coming up with a &#8220;new business model&#8221; for newspapers. If you have a new business model, then you&#8217;re not in the same business anymore. But you hear it discussed as if newspapers and journalism can remain fundamentally what they are, just with a new &#8220;business model&#8221; plugged in. Like a toy car that just needs new batteries to keep running.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the same type of thinking that leads to statements like this from the <a href="http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=31&amp;aid=154409">API CEO Summit</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The summit conference was a constructive dialog among senior industry leaders, serving as a catalyst for continuing conversation and efforts at reversing declining revenue and profit trends.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Reversing declining revenue and profit trends&#8221; &#8212; I just love that phrase. To continue the car analogy: Is your business going in the wrong direction? Oops, you must have it in the wrong gear. Just throw it into reverse.</p>
<p>Look, I&#8217;m not saying that media companies shouldn&#8217;t offer marketing services &#8212; they&#8217;ve been doing so for decades (e.g. custom publishing). And as brands increasingly want to provide content directly to consumers, marketing services may be a big growth area for media companies.</p>
<p>The problem is that once you cross the line to selling other companies&#8217; media because it&#8217;s more valuable than your own, then you face a fundamental question about why you&#8217;re going to the expense of producing your own.</p>
<p>Follow the logic here:</p>
<blockquote><p>What&#8217;s not being done is realizing that in your community &#8212; say, a 50,000 person community, you have 1,500 or 2,000 active advertisers but there are 8,000 businesses that serve consumers in your market. So three-quarters of them are not your customer. The difficult part is helping newspapers understand that if they want new business they need to get a new job done for businesses that they&#8217;re not serving.</p>
<div id="arc90_imcaption20" class="arc90_caption floatl" style="width: 240px;">
<p class="arc90_captionTXT" style="width: 240px;">
</div>
<p>It&#8217;s not that we don&#8217;t know what that is. Some of what they want is: a one-to-one relationship with customers; a way to respond to what&#8217;s going on in customers&#8217; lives; make sure they hear about me when they make a choice. The traditional product built on that job is the Yellow Pages, but I just read an article saying the Yellow Pages are expected to lose 39% of revenues in the next four years. Increasingly if we want to find something, we don&#8217;t go to the Yellow Pages, we go online, and Google doesn&#8217;t always work well.</p>
<p>Google isn&#8217;t doing it all that well yet, and the Yellow Pages aren&#8217;t doing it that well, so we&#8217;re saying, &#8216;Look this is where you [newspapers] should be.&#8217; It&#8217;s very hard for ad staffs and management at newspapers to get their minds around the fact that not everyone wants mass reach, and once you understand the needs, you take the technology available today and use them to get the job done.</p></blockquote>
<p>So newspaper should sell ads on Google because there is more value there for more businesses. That makes sense on the face of it. But what happens when those 1,500-2,000 newspaper advertisers also decide there&#8217;s more value on a highly targeted Google search result page then in the mass medium of the newspaper?</p>
<p>Again, I&#8217;m not saying that newspaper companies shouldn&#8217;t try to transform their businesses &#8212; most of them will have to in order to survive.  But companies that reinvent their business models typically find themselves in very different businesses, with very different products.</p>
<p>Just look at IBM. They used to sell mainframe computers &#8212; big pieces of enterprise hardware. Now they sell &#8220;solutions.&#8221; IBM transformed itself into a services company. Their business is no longer principally about hardware.</p>
<p>Newspaper companies could conceivably transform into local marketing services companies.</p>
<p>But if that happens, will their business still be principally about newspapers?</p>
<p>Will there be a place for journalism in a local ad agency?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/74ab11da-b415-11dd-8e35-0000779fd18c.html">analyst at Screen Digest estimates</a> that in “2008 YouTube will generate about $100m in the US, compared to about $70m at <a href="http://hulu.com">Hulu</a>. Next year both sites will generate about $180m in the US.” That’s very significant because YouTube had 83m unique viewers in the US in September, while Hulu only had 6m.</p>
<p>Here, in no particular order, are ten observations you could make from this data, which speak to the the future of media:<br />
<span id="more-1183"></span></p>
<ol>
<li>Professional content still has A LOT more value than “user-generated content.”</li>
<li>Legal content still has A LOT more value than illegal content.</li>
<li>Professional content produced for analogue media is worth pennies on the dollar when distributed in the web’s commoditizing content marketplace.</li>
<li>It probably costs a lot more than $180 million to produce the content on Hulu, which means that it&#8217;s not a standalone business.</li>
<li>Ads inserted into online video are about 1,000 times more annoying than TV ads (I say this having watched many shows on Hulu) &#8212; losing control of your content is not a web-native experience. This suppresses advertising value.</li>
<li>TV/Video will likely follow the path of music and newspapers in suffering a dramatic decline in content value on the web.</li>
<li>Video is probably not a panacea for newspapers trying to reinvent their businesses on the web.</li>
<li>Most analogue media businesses, when fully transitioned to the web, will likely bear little resemblance to the original businesses.</li>
<li>Google isn’t doing any better than anyone else at solving the content commoditization problem on the web.</li>
<li>Six years after Google perfected search advertising, there has been no innovation in online advertising that even comes close to the same scale.</li>
</ol>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The title of this post comes straight from the mind-blowing mind of Seth Godin, <a href="http://www.26thstory.com/blog/2008/11/1-we-have-a-fresh-slate-at-harperstudio-whats-your-advice---the-huge-opportunity-for-book-publishers-is-to-get-unstuck-yo.html">preaching to the book industry</a> (promoting his book <a href="http://sethgodin.com/sg/">Tribes</a>), but he could just as easily be preaching to anyone in media:</p>
<blockquote><p>[T]he market and the internet don&#8217;t care if you make money. That&#8217;s important to say. You have no right to make money from every development in media, and the humility that comes from approaching the market that way matters. It&#8217;s not &#8220;how can the market make me money&#8221; it&#8217;s &#8220;how can I do things for this market.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote><p>The market doesn&#8217;t care a whit about maintaining your industry. The lesson from Napster and iTunes is that there&#8217;s even MORE music than there was before. What got hurt was Tower and the guys in the suits and the unlimited budgets for groupies and drugs. The music will keep coming. Same thing is true with books.</p></blockquote>
<p>When I read this, I thought immediately of many assumptions the newspaper industry is making as the decline of its business model accelerates:<br />
<span id="more-1182"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>There has to be a new business model to support journalism with the same profit margins as newspapers have enjoyed in recent decades.</li>
<li>There has to be a way for newspapers to &#8220;reverse&#8221; the declines.</li>
<li>Newspapers will eventually find a way to make their web operations as large and profitable as their print operations once were.</li>
<li>Newspapers can&#8217;t be permitted to die, because then journalism will die.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the reality is that all of these assumptions may be wrong.</p>
<p>Why? Because the web and the market don&#8217;t care. The web is the most disruptive force in the history of media, by many orders of magnitude, destroying every assumption on which traditional media businesses are based.</p>
<p>But the market should care, you say. What would happen if we didn&#8217;t have the newspapers playing their Fourth Estate watch dog role?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the bitter truth &#8212; the feared loss of civic value is not the basis for a BUSINESS.</p>
<p>The problem with the newspaper industry, as with the music industry before it, is the sense of ENTITLEMENT. What we do is valuable. Therefore we have the right to make money.</p>
<p>Nobody has the right to a business model.</p>
<p>Ask not what the market can do for you, but what you can do for the market.</p>
<p>Every conversation about reinventing a business model for newspapers begins, it seems, with a question about how to find a way to pay for what we value in the current product. In other words, how do we find a way to keep doing what we&#8217;ve always done and make as much money as we&#8217;ve always made?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve rarely heard anyone start by asking what the market values. Where are the pain points in the market? How can we solve problems for people?</p>
<p>You know, business 101.</p>
<p>At Jeff Jarvis&#8217; conference last month on <a href="http://newsinnovation.com/">new business models for news</a>, I heard more out-of-the-box thinking in one day than I&#8217;ve had in the probably past year. But everyone had to constantly shoo the sacred cows out of the room.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been accused in recent months of Google worship, because I keep coming back again, and again, and AGAIN to Google&#8217;s business model.</p>
<p>Why? Because it&#8217;s the most successful media business on the web, by many orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>Why? Because Google solves a big problem for consumers. It helps them find stuff on the web they could never find on their own. And it solves a big problem for advertisers. It lets them buy traffic.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s a problem in the market that newspaper companies could solve? When I know what I&#8217;m looking for, Google helps me find it. But when it comes to news, I don&#8217;t always know what I&#8217;m looking for, because, well, it&#8217;s NEW. And I want the best of what&#8217;s on the WHOLE web, not just what one news brand has to offer.</p>
<p>That problem is still largely unsolved.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s just one example (and you can disagree about whether its a problem).</p>
<p>But Google as an icon is a double-edged sword. Google gave birth to the most destructive, soul-sucking, innovation-destroying notion in media today: monetization.</p>
<p>Nobody thought search was a business, until Google found a way to &#8220;monetize&#8221; it. Now everyone with something big, e.g. Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, etc., assumes there must be a way to monetize it, like Google did.</p>
<p>Newspapers and other traditional media put their content online and try to &#8220;monetize&#8221; it. We have it, therefore it must be worth something.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve got lots of page views, therefore they must be worth something. We&#8217;ve got lots of ad impressions, therefore they must be worth something.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s the problem &#8212; so does everyone else.</p>
<p>Everyone is chasing more TRAFFIC.</p>
<p>You know, just like everyone wanted &#8220;eyeballs&#8221; in the 90s.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve got some traffic, let&#8217;s monetize it.</p>
<p>But, frankly, the market doesn&#8217;t give a shit about your traffic.</p>
<p>So what does the market care about?</p>
<p>Networks.</p>
<p>The web media market is a giant network. Google figured out how to harness the network. But nobody else has yet.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not surprising. Media companies can only think about their own properties, their own content. They can&#8217;t let go of the monopoly control business which the web has already destroyed.</p>
<p>Since you made it this far in this post, I&#8217;ll tell you a secret, since this post was not meant to be defeatist, but rather a swift kick in the head.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s the secret. Legacy media companies can&#8217;t create a new business model for news and journalism by themselves.</p>
<p>They have to work TOGETHER, to build a network &#8212; a giant network of much smaller pieces, loosely joined.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.publish2.com/2008/02/29/how-networked-link-journalism-can-give-journalists-collectively-the-power-of-google-and-digg/">I&#8217;ve said this before</a>. And I&#8217;ll surely say it again.</p>
<p>But most of the media company executives who read this blog will shrug and go back to trying to figure how to prop up their monopolies.</p>
<p>And those monopolies will continue to crumble faster every day.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll write more about networks and media company collaboration in another post. In the meantime, I&#8217;m going to watch the the web&#8217;s disruption continue to blow up everyone&#8217;s assumptions (including whatever assumptions I still have left).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003888054">Newspaper CEOs are meeting for a closed-door summit</a> this week. Maybe someone will forward them this post. Or print it out and set it on fire in the middle of the conference table. Whatever works.</p>
<p>And as for Journalism, I&#8217;m less worried.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll repeat Seth: The lesson from Napster and iTunes is that there&#8217;s even MORE music than there was before.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve got highly entrepreneurial, creative, and driven people like <a href="http://www.publish2.com/journalists/david-cohn/">David Cohn</a> &#8212; who&#8217;s launching <a href="http://spot.us">spot.us</a> this week &#8212; working hard outside of newspaper company walls to invent new models for journalism</p>
<p>Journalism will find a way. Even if the industries that once supported it do not.</p>
<p>It took the ruination of the Bush Administration to create the right conditions for electing Barack Obama. Sometimes it has to all be torn down before you can begin to build it back up again.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://readingeagle.com">Reading Eagle</a> has brought their journalists out from behind the curtain to share with readers what they are reading on the web &#8212; often beyond what can be found on Reading&#8217;s own site. Their new <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/13/business/media/13reach.html?_r=1&amp;ref=media&amp;oref=slogin">link journalism</a> feature is called, appropriately enough, <a href="http://readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=108981">What We&#8217;re Reading</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://publishing2.com/images/reading-eagle-what-reading.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1172" title="reading-eagle-what-reading" src="http://publishing2.com/images/reading-eagle-what-reading.jpg" alt="" width="444" height="106" /></a></p>
<p>Each editor has a profile on the page with photo, email, Twitter, and links to what they are reading (courtesy of <a href="http://publish2.com">Publish2</a> widgets).  <span id="more-1169"></span>For example, assistant news editor <a href="http://www.publish2.com/journalists/karen-l-miller/">Karen Miller</a> shares interesting links on money and investing, adding her own perspective as context.</p>
<p><a href="http://publishing2.com/images/reading-eagle-karen-miller.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1170" title="reading-eagle-karen-miller" src="http://publishing2.com/images/reading-eagle-karen-miller.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="238" /></a></p>
<p>Readers can find <a href="http://www.publish2.com/journalists/karen-l-miller/links/">more of Karen&#8217;s great links here</a>.  Contributing to this group link blog are Reading&#8217;s editor, managing editor, assistant metro editor, web designer, and internet copy editor, so it&#8217;s a great cross section of the edit staff&#8217;s interests and perspective.  Administrative Editor <a href="http://www.publish2.com/journalists/johnboor/">John Boor</a> was one of the catalysts of this initiative:</p>
<p><a href="http://publishing2.com/images/reading-eagle-john-boor.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1171" title="reading-eagle-john-boor" src="http://publishing2.com/images/reading-eagle-john-boor.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="209" /></a></p>
<p>John explained in an email the thinking behind the What We&#8217;re Reading feature, what they have planned, and how they are going about it:</p>
<blockquote><p>The idea of linking to other news sources and providing a constantly updated list of linked-to stories is one of the goals.  We&#8217;re hoping to increase our site traffic in our own, smaller way, using the model of &#8220;The Drudge Report,&#8221; and others who, essentially, create success by being mega-aggregators.</p>
<p>Secondly, we see it as an opportunity to inject more personality into the site.  We&#8217;re hoping that people will connect with staffers&#8217; faces or names they&#8217;ve seen, and maybe keep checking back to see what one of their favorites thinks is important enough to share.</p>
<p>Third, it&#8217;s been a while now since I&#8217;ve seen the importance of social networking tools, such as Twitter, Facebook, etc., not only to aid journalists, but to engage readers and, basically, cast wide, digital nets in an effort to build a sense of community with our news site as the hub.  We&#8217;d like to encourage a much greater buy-in by those who visit our site, and by using these tools.  Publish2 has come along just in time to help us with that.  Now, with our &#8220;What we&#8217;re reading&#8221; page(s), we&#8217;re not just passing down our own material from our ivory towers.  We&#8217;re no longer the gatekeepers.  We&#8217;re stepping out onto the public square and sharing stories that are important to us and hoping they may help others.</p>
<p>Publish2 has given us a way to accomplish this project very easily.  We can populate the page dynamically, using the widget  you provide on each user&#8217;s links page.  We just have our staffers register with Publish2 and the rest is pretty much a piece of cake.  It is so easy to link from the browser toolbar widget that it takes very little additional time for our staffers to share what they&#8217;re reading.  In addition to this functionality, we really like the way Publish2 encourages the sharing of links, whether to our own news site or to others&#8217;.  It&#8217;s exciting to me to consider the possibilities.  I appreciate your efforts to provide this venue, allowing news organizations to cooperate in mutually beneficial ways, for the public good.  It doesn&#8217;t hurt, either, that it provides an alternative to the more traditional and expensive ways to procure and disseminate news and other worthwhile information.</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s so much I love about what Reading is doing. First, that they want to &#8220;inject more personality&#8221; into their site and build brands around their editorial staff. They are breaking free of the constraints of the newsprint medium, where journalists were faceless, inpersonal bylines. Their edit staff are real people with real interests, who can step &#8220;out onto the public square.&#8221; And they are taking a truly web-native approach, which has proven successful for publications born on the web &#8212; it&#8217;s about people and connections.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s notable that Reading isn&#8217;t spending precious dollars trying to develop their own technology, and they aren&#8217;t paying for an algorithm to provide impersonal, semi-relevant links.  They are using a <a href="http://publish2.com">free web application</a> to tap into what their journalists are ALREADY reading, adding comments and perspective, and sharing that with their readers. And that&#8217;s how they can connect with their readers in a way that no algorithm can &#8212; it&#8217;s people sharing on the web.</p>
<p>And that gets to another idea I love &#8212; using social networking tools to &#8220;cast wide, digital nets in an effort to build a sense of community with our news site as the hub&#8221; &#8212; for example, John is taking the links he contributes to What We&#8217;re Reading and <a href="http://blog.publish2.com/2008/10/29/link-once-publish-everywhere-publish2-launches-connection-to-twitter-and-delicious/">simultaneous sharing</a> them <a href="http://twitter.com/johnboor/status/992322685">on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also excited that they see the potential for &#8220;an alternative to the more traditional and expensive ways to procure and disseminate news and other worthwhile information.&#8221; There is a huge potential for Reading and other newsrooms to collaborate on creating a <a href="http://blog.publish2.com/2008/09/03/publish2-the-webs-newswire/">new newswire for the web</a>, one based on links instead of licensing fees. Imagine the possibilities as more newsrooms join Reading.</p>
<p>This is just the first step for Reading in incorporating link journalism and news aggregation into what they do, as a complement to their own original reporting (and they read that, too!). What&#8217;s essential is that they STARTED and have given themselves a basis for learning and innovating. I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing what else they come up with.</p>
<p>Reading also shows that the ambition to innovate and the ability to harness technology for editorial innovation is not just the province of the big national newspapers. In fact, Reading is making better use of technology to easily and collaboratively scale up their news aggregation efforts than some big media companies that are still using some rather old-fashioned editorial processes for link journalism.</p>
<p>My <a href="http://publishing2.com/2008/09/15/drudge-report-news-site-that-sends-readers-away-with-links-has-highest-engagement/">post about the success of the Drudge Report</a> was widely read, but here&#8217;s a newsroom that didn&#8217;t just read about harnessing the power of news aggregation on the web &#8212; they are actually going to DO it.</p>
<p>So why aren&#8217;t you <a href="http://publish2.com/register">doing it</a>?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most newsrooms have utterly narcissistic Twitter accounts. The worst offenders (which unfortunately is the majority) use services like <a href="http://twitterfeed.com">Twitterfeed</a> to automatically tweet links to the newspaper&#8217;s own content. Here&#8217;s our RSS feed on Twitter! Don&#8217;t get enough of our content on our site or through RSS? Now get it on Twitter, too!</p>
<p>Some newsrooms are slightly better in that there is an actual human being who uses the Twitter feed to let followers know about new content on the newsroom&#8217;s site, in a conversational tone. Still, it&#8217;s all about sharing OUR content.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder why <a href="http://graphicdesignr.net/blog/2008/10/09/september-newspapers-that-use-twitter/">so many newsrooms have fewer Twitter followers</a> than many individuals on Twitter &#8212; especially when these newsrooms have print and web audiences numbering in the hundreds of thousands or millions &#8212; a lot more people than the average individual knows. In fact, if you <a href="http://graphicdesignr.net/blog/2008/10/09/september-newspapers-that-use-twitter/">look at the numbers</a>, individual journalists typically have a lot more followers than their newsrooms.</p>
<p><span id="more-1168"></span>This is a perfect example of how mainstream news orgs got so far behind on the web &#8212; they see the web as just another distribution channel for their own content. Open the chute and shovel the content in.</p>
<p>Can you think of any PERSON that you follow on Twitter who does nothing but link to their own blog posts? That&#8217;s not how real people use Twitter, and not how Twitter became so popular.</p>
<p>For me, Twitter has become one of the most interesting sources of links &#8212; to news, resources, funny stuff. Twtitter has become a primary platform for link blogging, in the classic sense.</p>
<p>For example, Jay Rosen, who has 10 times as many followers as most newsrooms, is prolific <a href="http://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu">source of interesting links on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of seeing Twitter as another place to dump their content, newsrooms should see it as a way to create a whole new dimension of value under their editorial brand.</p>
<p>Many newsrooms are doing this through &#8220;live Tweeting&#8221; everything from ball games to trials. Tweeting while watching is certainty a popular use of Twitter, so this is promising.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s another dimension to Twitter that newsrooms are entirely missing &#8212; sharing interesting stuff. As newsrooms increasingly look to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/13/business/media/13reach.html?_r=1&amp;ref=media&amp;oref=slogin">link journalism</a> and news aggregation as a way to create value for their readers, they should look to their Twitter accounts as an easy platform for sharing links.</p>
<p>If newsrooms want more Twitter followers, they need to be INTERESTING. And since they can&#8217;t as easily be quirky interesting, i.e. sharing random thoughts and experiences, and obvious way to be interesting is to share links.</p>
<p>The magic of Twitter is that users have invented so many different new ways to use it.</p>
<p>Newsrooms should make Twitter into a platform for <a href="http://www.publish2.com/about/what-is-link-journalism">link journalism</a>. Local news orgs should set up Twitter feeds where they link to interesting non-local news (i.e. NOT AP!).</p>
<p>And of course it&#8217;s fine to mix in links to your own content &#8212; just don&#8217;t be a dull Tweeter by making it ALL about your content.</p>
<p>And shameless plug &#8212; using Twitter for link journalism is now super easy with the new <a href="http://publish2.com">Publish2</a> connection to Twitter. <a href="http://blog.publish2.com/2008/10/29/link-once-publish-everywhere-publish2-launches-connection-to-twitter-and-delicious/">Save a link on Publish2 and send it simultaneously to Twitter</a> (and delicious, and soon Facebook, Movable Type, and WordPress). With Publish2, newsrooms can use the same links that they share on Twitter to create news aggregation features on their sites (a bit of efficiency for newsrooms with limited resources). Check out the <a href="http://blog.publish2.com/2008/10/29/link-once-publish-everywhere-publish2-launches-connection-to-twitter-and-delicious/">details on the Publish2 blog</a>. (You can <a href="http://www.publish2.com/register/">register for Publish2 here</a>.)</p>
<p>There&#8217;s already evidence that <a href="http://graphicdesignr.net/blog/2008/09/30/newspaper-turns-off-twitterfeed-gains-followers/">newsrooms that shut off the Twitterfeed auto-shovel significantly increase their followers</a>.</p>
<p>So shut off that Twitterfeed. Link to interesting stuff and grow your Twitter audience.</p>
<p>Then, when you publish something that&#8217;s really special or important, you&#8217;ll have a bigger audience to share it with.</p>
<p>And who knows &#8212; maybe your Twitter followers will share interesting links with you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the eve of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/insideguardian/2008/oct/22/full-fat-rss-feed-upgrade">The Guardian&#8217;s launch of full text RSS feeds</a>, <a href="http://www.mattmcalister.com/">Matt McAlister</a>, Head of Guardian Developer Network, pinged me looking for examples of other mainstream media companies that have full text RSS feeds. Surely this many years into the age of syndication, Guardian couldn&#8217;t be the first mainstream media company to adopt full RSS feeds, which nearly every major independent blog has had since inception. The technology for inserting ads into RSS feeds is simple (heck, even I figured it out) and has been around for years.</p>
<p>But neither Matt nor I could find any examples. How unbelievably sad.</p>
<p>But not for The Guardian &#8212; they get to be the first media company to actually take RSS seriously, to actually make the offering something users would want to USE.</p>
<p>In fact, I think The Guardian holds the distinction of being the first mainstream media company not to actively SUPPRESS RSS adoption by publishing abbreviated feeds.</p>
<p><span id="more-1166"></span>What every other mainstream media company does with their RSS feeds is publish a brief excerpt of the content, forcing readers to click on the headline and visit the publisher&#8217;s site in order to actually read the content.</p>
<p>Why? So the publisher can serve ads.</p>
<p>And the problem with this? It defeats the entire purpose of RSS!</p>
<p>The value of using an RSS reader is that you can read content from dozens (or more) sites all in one place without having to visit all of those sites.</p>
<p>But if all the RSS feeds you subscribe to have only an excerpt, and you have to click through to read anything, you spend your entire time clicking to other sites. Which is completely annoying!</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s why most people who use RSS readers don&#8217;t bother to subscribe to partial content feeds.</p>
<p>And&#8230; I think this is one of the reasons why RSS adoption has not gone mainstream.</p>
<p>Mainstream media is still mainstream because that&#8217;s what that largest number of people consume. Can you imagine sitting an average web media consumer down and trying to convince them to use an RSS reader with partial feeds from all their favorite mainstream media sites?</p>
<p>FAIL!</p>
<p>Every mainstream media company will argue that they need to use partial RSS feeds to MANIPULATE their users into coming to their sites so they can serve ads.</p>
<p>Which makes sense, if you believe that manipulating users is the best way to build brand loyalty.</p>
<p>The only problem with that argument is&#8230; you can serve ads in RSS feeds! That&#8217;s what The Guardian plans to do.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2008/10/reading-guardian-full-text-style.html">Google Reader blog reported</a> The Guardian is the &#8220;first major newspaper in the world&#8221; to have full text RSS feeds.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d argue that The Guardian is the first major media company in the world to have RSS feeds AT ALL.</p>
<p>All of the others with partial feeds &#8212; it&#8217;s a joke. It&#8217;s something that they bury at the bottom of the site so they can claim to have fully embraced web technology.</p>
<p>But they haven&#8217;t. They are supressing web technology. And they are surpressing the potential both for mainstream adoption and for advertisers to take feeds seriously as a channel for advertising.</p>
<p>I hope for The Guardian&#8217;s sake that they are able to build a sizable RSS audience that is appealing to their advertisers, and that they are able to profit while everyone else sits on the sidelines.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The New York Times published an article this week about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/13/business/media/13reach.html?_r=1&amp;ref=media&amp;oref=slogin">mainstream news organizations embracing link journalism and news aggregation</a>. <a href="http://gawker.com/5062811/newspapers-invent-concept-of-links">Gawker</a> and others scoffed that they are late to the game, which they are, but that misses (predictably) the BIG story.</p>
<p>If news orgs like the NYT, Washington Post, and hundreds of newspaper sites start linking to news and other content around the web in a big way, on their front pages (as the NYT plans) and across their sites, it will have a HUGE impact on the web&#8217;s <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/2008/06/18/the-link-economy-v-the-content-economy/">link economy</a>. These news orgs may have been slow to realize how linking drives content distribution and allocates attention and advertising wealth. But now that they&#8217;ve figured it out, they can completely disrupt the balance of power.</p>
<p><span id="more-1164"></span>Yahoo became a huge force for driving traffic when it started featuring links from <a href="http://buzz.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Buzz</a> on its homepage. Imagine the NYT, Washington Post, CNN, MSNBC, and all of the mainstream news sites that still <a href="http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003850210">dominate news on the web</a> all getting into the linking game.</p>
<p>Imagine the NYTimes.com homepage, like Digg, driving server-crashing volumes of traffic.</p>
<p>And imagine the impact on Google. Bloggers and other independent publishers determine so much of Google&#8217;s ranking because for the longest time they were the only ones who linked to anything &#8212; so those were the only links Google had to read.</p>
<p>But no more.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another major factor in this disruption of the web content ecosystem &#8212; the unwinding of the Associated Press. Today, <a href="http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003874855">Tribune became the first major newspaper chain to give notice to AP</a> that they are canceling their contract.</p>
<p>Now imagine that instead of publishing commodity AP articles on their sites, every Tribune newspaper <a href="http://publishing2.com/2008/10/07/the-new-ap/">linked to national and international news from sources all over the web</a>.</p>
<p>And now imagine that the audiences of these newspaper sites, many of whom may have little or no experience with news aggregation a la Digg, start clicking on all of these links.</p>
<p>Imagine if aggregation sites like Drudge and Digg, which remain locked in their niches, started to have competition from mainstream brands who put <a href="http://publishing2.com/2008/09/17/why-every-news-site-should-put-a-continuously-updated-news-aggregation-on-the-homepage/">continuously updated news aggregations</a> on their homepages.</p>
<p>Imagine the <a href="http://publishing2.com/2008/09/28/washingtonpostcoms-political-browser-uses-the-news-judgment-of-journalists-to-filter-the-political-web/">Washington Post&#8217;s Political Browser</a> with a bigger audience than Drudge. (It&#8217;s no wonder that after the Post launched Political Browser their phone started ringing off the hook from people interested in receiving those links.)</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter if the 800 pound gorilla is late to the party &#8212; he&#8217;s still going to shake things up.</p>
<p>And for all the news orgs whose monopoly distribution business is <a href="http://newsosaur.blogspot.com/2008/10/75b-sales-plunge-forecast-for.html">rapidly declining</a>, there&#8217;s a highly profitable distribution business on the web, driven by links, which has largely been <a href="http://investor.google.com/releases/2008Q3.html">conceded to one player</a>. Time to steal some market share in the online content distribution market.</p>
<p>(Hint: Forget display ads, which are <a href="http://publishing2.com/2008/05/24/why-traditional-advertising-formats-fail-on-the-web/">lame reproducitons of print display ads</a> &#8212; that market is <a href="http://newsosaur.blogspot.com/2008/10/online-cpms-fell-46-since-january.html">going nowhere</a>. Focus on new models that <a href="http://publishing2.com/2008/09/22/why-isnt-facebook-making-more-money-hint-advertiser-value-and-user-value-are-not-aligned/">align with the value</a> of news aggregation.)</p>
<p>Last bit of imagining &#8212; imagine mainstream news organizations realize that economic power on the web is in networks, not the the monolithic monopolies that defined their analogu businesses, and that to build successful business on the web, they need to <a href="http://publishing2.com/2008/10/09/will-algorithms-make-human-editors-obsolete-not-if-journalists-collaborate/">COLLABORATE</a>. Yeah, I know that one is hard to imagine. But with the <a href="http://www.journalism.co.uk/2/articles/532538.php">amount of disruption</a> the media business is facing, news orgs may start figuring it out a lot faster.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are several reasons why most mainstream news organizations have been slow to embrace <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/13/business/media/13reach.html?_r=1&amp;ref=media&amp;oref=slogin" target="_blank">link journalism</a>.</p>
<p>First, news orgs typically act as though other news orgs don’t exist (blame long-standing notions of &#8220;owning&#8221; the news, and more recent <a href="http://publishing2.com/2008/09/15/drudge-report-news-site-that-sends-readers-away-with-links-has-highest-engagement/" target="_blank">unjustified fears</a> of sending readers away). Second, news orgs had few mechanisms for breaking out of that walled-garden mentality online &#8212; for <a href="http://publishing2.com/2008/10/07/the-new-ap/" target="_blank">finding good stories</a> among the web’s reaches, and delivering those stories to readers &#8212; even if they wanted to.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s a third, more fundamental, barrier to linking: Many journalists worry about the wild wild web.</p>
<p><span id="more-1162"></span></p>
<p>As Carolyn Washburn <a href="http://publishing2.com/2008/10/07/the-new-ap/#comment-555771" target="_blank">commented</a> on my <a href="http://publishing2.com/2008/10/07/the-new-ap/" target="_blank">post about a link-based newswire</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>We need to ensure a process by which we understand the sources of the content, the understanding that not all links are created equal. We need to guarantee the expertise. The standards those sources apply for balance and news judgment.</p></blockquote>
<p>Robert Fisk was blunter in a <a href="http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2008/09/22/robert-fisk-%E2%80%9Cto-hell-with-the-web-it%E2%80%99s-got-no-responsibility%E2%80%9D/" target="_blank">recent lecture</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“To hell with the web, it’s got no responsibility.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s true that there&#8217;s lots of unverifiable garbage online (which journalists&#8217; <a href="http://publishing2.com/2008/10/09/will-algorithms-make-human-editors-obsolete-not-if-journalists-collaborate/" target="_blank">networked editorial judgment</a> can nonetheless help filter from the good stuff). What many people tend to forget is that the web also makes accessible basically <em>every reputable news outlet and thinker on the planet</em>. Think of all that as the Internet&#8217;s natural spring &#8212; the total-information flipside to <span id=":sh" dir="ltr">Google CEO </span>Eric Schmidt&#8217;s <a href="http://adage.com/mediaworks/article?article_id=131569" target="_blank">&#8220;cesspool.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>A typical newspaper may draw from two or three dozen sources, depending on which wire services it uses. In contrast, there are conservatively more than 2,000 newspapers, magazines, and web sites (e.g. <a href="http://slate.com/" target="_blank">Slate</a>, <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/" target="_blank">Talking Points Memo</a>, <a href="http://washingtonindependent.com/" target="_blank">Washington Independent</a>, journalists&#8217; <a href="http://www.hitsville.org/" target="_blank">blogs</a>) in the U.S. alone that newspapers could link to without worry.</p>
<p>Add blogs written by academics (e.g. <a href="http://balkin.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Balkinization</a> on law, <a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/" target="_blank">Language Log</a> on language, <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/" target="_blank">Marginal Revolution</a> on economics) and think-tankers, and that number is probably more like 2,500 to 3,000.</p>
<p>Nervous news organizations can embrace link journalism by tapping the spring &#8212; they don&#8217;t have to dip even one editorial toe into the cesspool. (Hooray for stretched metaphors!)</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s worth it? Consider Talking Points Memo: Josh Marshall and his crew didn&#8217;t own the U.S. Attorney story (and win a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Polk_Award" target="_blank">George Polk award</a>) by linking to cranks and anonymous message boards. They <a href="http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/us-attorneys/2007/03/" target="_blank">did it</a> by supplementing their own reporting with <a href="http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2007/01/whats_the_white_house_doing_to.php" target="_blank">links to other mainstream news organizations</a> and to <a href="http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2007/03/doc_lists_attorneys_in_the_pro.php" target="_blank">documents</a>, legislators&#8217; letters, etc.</p>
<p>Yes, we need to encourage ethics, trust, and transparency on the web. These standards are what turn linking into <a href="http://publish2.com/about/what-is-link-journalism" target="_blank">link journalism</a>, and they will become ever more important as the power of the press spreads among millions of citizens.</p>
<p>But the cesspool isn&#8217;t all-consuming. And it shouldn&#8217;t discourage journalists from linking today.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Will algorithms replace human editors on the web? It&#8217;s a bogeyman question on one level, but ask any news site about the percentage of traffic they get from search engines &#8212; and what the trend looks like &#8212; and you&#8217;ll realize that algorithms are increasingly deciding what we pay attention to, what is important, what is relevant. It&#8217;s part of how journalists and news orgs have <a href="http://publishing2.com/2008/09/21/how-newspapers-abdicated-the-front-pages-influence-and-how-they-can-get-it-back-by-linking/">abdicated their traditional roles on the web</a>.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not just Google &#8212; news sites are increasingly filled with links generated by algorithms that suggest to readers what else they ought to read. And that&#8217;s because most news site still see original content creation as their sole purpose &#8212; they don&#8217;t see the tremendous need, and the tremendous value in filtering the content that already exists. They don&#8217;t see that every link on their site is an important editorial judgment, not an afterthought, not an algorithmic process to set and forget (which often leads to algorithms making bad recommendations, as many news sites who use them will tell you).</p>
<p><span id="more-1161"></span>Giving over the function of choosing links, of filtering the web, to an algorithm is an implicit devaluation of the quality of human judgment, of what makes an individual editor&#8217;s perspective so interesting. That&#8217;s why link bloggers like <a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/">Andrew Sullivan</a>, <a href="http://pajamasmedia.com/instapundit/">Glenn Reynolds</a>, <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/">Josh Marshall</a>, and <a href="http://www.drudgereport.com/">Matt Drudge</a> have become such a powerful force on the web. They understood, even where traditional news orgs did not, the value of bringing their unique perspectives to filtering the web, of having a &#8220;<a href="http://publishing2.com/2008/09/17/why-every-news-site-should-put-a-continuously-updated-news-aggregation-on-the-homepage/#comment-543933">linking voice</a>.&#8221; They understood the editorial power of the link.</p>
<p>Handing over the editorial selection of links to an algorithm is also an implicit concession that human news judgment isn&#8217;t up to the task. It&#8217;s too overwhelming, too much work, so just let the machines take over.</p>
<p>And there are obviously times when you want a machine to take over &#8212; searching the billions of pages on the web for some obscure piece of information, and doing so comprehensively, is where algorithms are a godsend.</p>
<p>But while algorithms may excel at processing vast amounts of data by brute force, they are only as smart as the rules we give them. Algorithms can simulate human intelligence &#8212; but algorithms have no judgment &#8212; and certainly no news judgment. Algorithms can&#8217;t do <a href="http://publish2.com/about/what-is-link-journalism">link journalism</a>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the brilliance of Google &#8212; it&#8217;s actually driven by human judgment, by the judgment that someone producing a website makes every time they link to something. Rather than replacing human judgment, Google is actually co-opting it.</p>
<p>But Google isn&#8217;t co-opting the judgment of most journalists and news orgs &#8212; because so many of them still don&#8217;t link to anything. (<a href="http://publishing2.com/2008/09/28/washingtonpostcoms-political-browser-uses-the-news-judgment-of-journalists-to-filter-the-political-web/">Notable</a> <a href="http://publishing2.com/2008/05/22/new-york-times-embraces-link-journalism/">exceptions</a> notwithstanding.)</p>
<p>Still, the obvious question is how can human editors compete with the brute force of an algorithm, which never tires, never has a busy day, never gets distracted? (Cue Terminator music.)</p>
<p>Well, human editors aren&#8217;t going to compete very well with the old go it alone model of journalism.</p>
<p>But they can compete through COLLABORATION.</p>
<p>Digg has proven that collaborative human editorial effort can cover a massive amount of territory on the web.</p>
<p>Imagine if journalists and news orgs brought together their combined editorial intelligence, their combined news judgment.</p>
<p>Suddenly the advantage of an algorithm&#8217;s scale in filtering the web doesn&#8217;t seem so insurmountable.</p>
<p>It may be overwhelming for one editor to fact check what Google CEO Eric Schmidt called <a href="http://adage.com/mediaworks/article?article_id=131569">the &#8220;cesspool&#8221; of false information on the web</a>. But imagine journalists collaborating to verify what they link to.</p>
<p>Even within a newsroom &#8212; and even for the many newsrooms grappling with shrinking resources &#8212; collaboration could yield a powerful editorial filter.</p>
<p>In fact, the more that resources shrink, the more essential collaboration becomes.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know, collaboration isn&#8217;t in the traditional journalism playbook. But insert here the almost cliched reference to swiftly declining business models, now aided by economic decline, and, well&#8230; do we really need to be having that conversation anymore?</p>
<p>Just look at where the most innovative, entrepreneurial minds in journalism have focused their efforts &#8212; it&#8217;s all about collaboration:</p>
<p><a href="http://ryansholin.com">Ryan Sholin</a> just launched <a href="http://reportingon.com">ReportingOn</a>, a site where journalists share in short Twitter-like messages what they are reporting on &#8212; with the aim of actually HELPING each other. With fewer journalists in newsrooms doing original reporting, doesn&#8217;t it make perfect sense that more and better reporting could get done collaboratively? Why should a beat be a solo effort?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s is also the idea behind <a href="http://beatblogging.org/">Beat Blogging</a>, the brainchild of <a href="http://pressthink.org">Jay Rosen</a>, with <a href="http://patthorntonfiles.com/blog/">journalism iconoclast Patrick Thornton</a> now leading the charge. The idea is for journalists to develop social networks to improve their beat reporting &#8212; by collaborating with people involved with and interested in the topics they cover, journalists can do better reporting. (Beat Blogging is even <a href="http://www.publish2.com/newsgroups/beat-blogging">collaborating to find great examples of beat blogging</a>.)</p>
<p>Speaking of collaborating with communities, Mark Briggs, of <a href="http://journalism20.com">Journalism 2.0</a> fame, co-founded a company called <a href="http://serramedia.com">Serra Media</a>, whose first product <a href="http://publishing2.com/wp-admin/erramedia.net/products.html">Newsgarden</a> is a map-based local news platform that allows news orgs to collaborate with their communities to publish hyperlocal news. And their bet is that journalists and community members all posting hyperlocal news as they come across it can do a better job than algorithm-based local sites in judging what news is important to the community.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.digidave.org/">David Cohn</a>, who will soon be launching <a href="http://spot.us">Spot.us</a>, where a community can collaborate to actually pay for the journalism that the community needs. A community brings money and interest in issues, journalists bring their reporting skills, and, collaboratively, journalism happens.</p>
<p>See the pattern here? It&#8217;s about how a group of people, empowered by technology to collaborate, can accomplish much more than one person can by themselves.</p>
<p>And the idea that news orgs can accomplish more together than they can by themselves isn&#8217;t so foreign to journalism &#8212; it&#8217;s the basis of the newswire. So it&#8217;s not that hard to imagine a <a href="http://publish2.com">collaborative newswire based on links</a>, where journalists help each other filter the web.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that hard to imagine journalists, collaborating with each other and the communities they serve, becoming most powerful editorial intelligence on the web.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.newsless.org/2008/10/not-to-overhype-this/" target="_blank">Matt Thompson</a> and <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/2008/09/30/the-building-block-of-journalism-is-no-longer-the-article/" target="_blank">Jeff Jarvis</a> have been doing some important thinking on how news coverage needs to change in the Internet Age. They argue that a flow of shallow, time-dependent stories no longer works as a foundation for helping readers understand the world.</p>
<p>Thompson started a blog devoted to <a href="http://www.newsless.org/" target="_blank">exploring an alternative</a>. He <a href="http://www.newsless.org/2008/09/hello-world/" target="_blank">writes</a> in the introductory post:</p>
<blockquote><p>Until recently, newspaper editors defined news as “important developments over the past 24 hours.” &#8230; My understanding of journalism is broader. To me, journalism is the constant effort to deliver a truer picture of the world as it is. The “latest developments” provide one lens through which to capture that picture. And as long as journalism was primarily delivered by static media, that lens made perfect sense.</p>
<p>The Web, however, makes possible other ways of delivering that picture of our evolving world. It allows us to shirk the tyranny of recency and place more emphasis on <strong>context</strong> &#8211; the information that often gets buried beneath the news.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jarvis takes the idea <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/2008/09/30/the-building-block-of-journalism-is-no-longer-the-article/" target="_blank">further</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[A] discrete and serial series of articles over days cannot adequately cover the complex stories going on now nor can they properly inform the public. There’s too much repetition. Too little explanation. The knowledge is not cumulative. Each instance is necessarily shallow. And when more big stories come — as they have lately! — in scarce time and space and with scarce resources, each becomes even shallower. We never catch up, we never get smarter. Articles perpetuate a Ground Hog Day kind of journalism.</p>
<p>[snip]</p>
<p>I think the new building block of journalism needs to be the topic. &#8230; I want a page, a site, a thing that is created, curated, edited, and discussed.</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree with both of them. (Disclosure: Matt&#8217;s a friend, and Jarvis is on the board of Publish2, where <a href="http://www.publish2.com/journalists/josh-korr">I&#8217;m an editor</a>.) But there&#8217;s an ink-stained elephant in the room that needs to be faced if Thompson&#8217;s <a href="http://www.newsless.org/2008/10/not-to-overhype-this/" target="_blank">feeling</a> that &#8220;we’re on the verge of an epochal advancement in journalism&#8221; is to come true.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m talking, of course, about the Associated Press.</p>
<p><span id="more-1158"></span></p>
<p>The AP plays a major, but often unacknowledged, role in the modern news ecosystem. Aside from the handful of papers that can still afford a worldwide or national reporting staff, most papers&#8217; non-local coverage draws heavily from the AP (sometimes supplemented by wire services from Washington Post, New York Times, L.A. Times, McClatchy, Bloomberg, Reuters, etc.).</p>
<p>This coverage is important &#8212; AP is usually the first to report on major stories, particularly in out-of-the-way places. But it has also contributed to the spread of what, in my <a href="http://www.publish2.com/journalists/josh-korr" target="_blank">work</a> as a <a href="http://korrvalues.com/2008/02/17/how-to-fix-journalism-prelude/" target="_blank">wire editor</a>, I came to think of as AP&#8217;s house style: voiceless (the <a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=546" target="_blank">Ron Fournier</a> <a href="http://gawker.com/5059427/ap-switches-tanks-calls-palin-a-racist" target="_blank">Effect</a> <a href="http://gawker.com/5053903/subtle-media-sarcasm-watch" target="_blank">notwithstanding</a>), incrementally updated, process-oriented, one sentence of &#8220;news&#8221; stretched to 12 paragraphs.</p>
<p>Such stories aren&#8217;t always engaging or interesting, nor are they effective in providing understanding. Without context, they can induce news overload. As Jay Rosen recently <a href="http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2008/08/13/national_explain.html" target="_blank">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the normal hierarchy of journalistic achievement the most “basic” acts are reporting today’s news and providing current information, as with prices, weather reports and ball scores. We think of “analysis,” “interpretation,” and also “explanation” as higher order acts. They come after the news has been reported, building upon a base of factual information laid down by prior reports. &#8230; That’s the way it works… right?</p>
<p>Wrong!  For there are some stories—and the mortgage crisis is a great example—where until I grasp the <em>whole </em> I am unable to make sense of <em>any</em> part. Not only am I not a customer for news reports prior to that moment, but the very frequency of the updates alienates me from the providers of those updates because the news stream is adding daily to my feeling of being ill-informed, overwhelmed, out of the loop. I respond with indifference, even though I’ve picked up a blinking red light from the news system’s repeated placement of “subprime” items in front of me.</p></blockquote>
<p>None of this is meant to denigrate individual AP journalists, who do tons of great and important work. The issue is institutional &#8212; as much a function of objectivity-era daily journalism as of house style.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Internet&#8217;s depth and variety have made newspapers&#8217; pool of wire sources look increasingly shallow.</p>
<p>For any given story, the most interesting and informative takes often come from sources other than the traditional newswires. On any given day, the stuff that actually makes people smile (when was the last time a newspaper made that a goal?) is found not on the AP wire, but in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfK-UzQ48JE" target="_blank">viral videos</a>, Cute Overload <a href="http://mfrost.typepad.com/cute_overload/2008/10/nooooooooooo-sh.html" target="_blank">photos</a>, and Best Week Ever <a href="http://www.bestweekever.tv/2008/10/03/the-saddest-wikipedia-page-on-the-net/" target="_blank">posts</a>.</p>
<p>The longer newsrooms ignore this amazing universe of content, the less relevant they are for readers. The longer the AP fails to help newsrooms find this content, the less useful it will be. A <a href="http://www.ap.org/pages/about/pressreleases/pr_092908a.html" target="_blank">content-sharing service</a> is a good start, but I think the AP &#8212; like other wire services &#8212; fundamentally misunderstands what a web-era newswire needs to offer. (Though in fairness, most AP member papers are still focused on print.)</p>
<p>Not just more <a href="http://www.ap.org/choice/faq.html" target="_blank">in-house niche content</a>, but more of the best content from all over the web, regardless of the source: More engaging one-off stories and ephemera, as well as more relevant and understandable analysis and context.</p>
<p>The AP&#8217;s not alone; no wire service covers papers large and small, blogs, magazines, and web sites. But on the web you don&#8217;t need to pay anyone to help you bring great stories to readers. All you have to do is link.</p>
<p>Finding all this material is another matter. Individual bloggers do their part each time they link, but there hasn&#8217;t been a good way to aggregate the blogosphere&#8217;s links.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the real mission of a <a href="http://publishing2.com/2008/09/03/publish2-the-webs-newswire/" target="_blank">wire service</a> for the web era: Not to provide full-text versions of a single source&#8217;s (or handful of sources&#8217;) news, but to offer links to the best stuff culled from ALL sources.</p>
<p>And since nobody&#8217;s doing that, we&#8217;re going to give it a shot. Call it the web&#8217;s newswire, version 1.0; <a href="http://publish2.com">Publish2</a> as the new AP.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve created a Publish2 newsgroup called <a href="http://www.publish2.com/newsgroups/the-wire" target="_blank">The Wire</a>. Armed with a packed RSS reader, I&#8217;ll be saving links on all manner of topics from all kinds of sources. The goal is to provide a thorough, interesting, and engaging wire for news organizations that want to start moving beyond the AP or are forced to do so for budgetary reasons.</p>
<p>This link wire could be an answer for editors like Steve Buttry of The (Iowa) Gazette, who writes, in a recent <a href="http://www.gazetteonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081004/NEWS/810049989&amp;SearchID=73331980449652" target="_blank">cancellation letter</a> to the AP, &#8220;I don’t know yet how The Gazette will operate without AP content.&#8221;</p>
<p>Imagine this scenario: The print edition of The Gazette becomes &#8220;an all-local newspaper&#8221; supplemented by content-sharing, as Buttry suggests in his letter. And every day the paper includes a note to readers:</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re still going to cover non-local stories, but in a new way. On our website, we&#8217;re linking to the best of these stories –- from many sources, not just the narrow range we used to print &#8212; to try to make the news more understandable, engaging, and interesting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, The Gazette has set up web sections of curated links to the best national, international, business, entertainment, sports, etc. news and commentary &#8212; links drawn initially from feeds of The Wire&#8217;s <a href="http://www.publish2.com/newsgroups/the-wire/Entertainment" target="_blank">tag</a> <a href="http://www.publish2.com/newsgroups/the-wire/Business" target="_blank">pages</a>. The Gazette could even publish a Drudge Report-type page of The Wire&#8217;s links on <a href="http://www.publish2.com/newsgroups/the-wire" target="_blank">all topics</a>.</p>
<p>Voila: not just sustained but  <em>improved</em> coverage, without having to pay a cent.</p>
<p>This is not an argument to kill the AP. Indeed, any thorough link wire would certainly include AP stories. This is an argument about the centrality of AP-type stories in the web-news mix, and the utility of the AP as a distribution mechanism for web-focused news organizations.</p>
<p>I realize that one person acting as editorial gatekeeper goes against any number of principles of web journalism. Ultimately, this newswire will be powered by the collective editorial judgment of thousands of journalists linking stories. (Anyone who would like to contribute or suggest links is welcome to ping me at josh [dot] korr [at] publish2 [dot] com.)</p>
<p>For that to happen, there needs to be a shift not only in the conception of a wire service, but also in the conception of the link itself.</p>
<p>Journalists need to understand that <a href="http://blog.publish2.com/2007/10/24/the-editor-as-curator-of-all-the-news-on-the-web/" target="_blank">finding and curating links</a> is as important to web journalism as original reporting. They need to understand once and for all that <a href="http://www.publish2.com/about/what-is-link-journalism" target="_blank">linking <em>is</em> journalism</a>.</p>
<p>This is why algorithm-based link services are not the answer. It takes human intelligence and judgment to turn a flood of information into a coherent news story (i.e. reporting); it takes the same intelligence and judgment to turn a flood of news stories into a coherent body of links.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the radical evolution Matt Thompson <a href="http://www.newsless.org/2008/10/not-to-overhype-this/" target="_blank">senses</a> is at hand: Journalists using their expertise and judgment to filter the web and make the news make sense.</p>
<p>Links make context- and topic-focused journalism possible &#8212; not to mention journalism that&#8217;s surprising and fun instead of predictable and boring. All we need is a way to find those links and make them accessible to all news organizations.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s get to it.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPT: I&#8217;ll be fleshing out this vision further on the <a href="http://blog.publish2.com" target="_blank">Publish2 blog</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Someone <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/081003/p30#a081003p30">posted a false report</a> that Steve Jobs had heart attack to CNN&#8217;s citizen journalism site <a href="http://www.ireport.com/index.jspa">iReport</a>. The fallout (which could include an SEC investigation) lead to the inevitable question of whether this is a failure of citizen journalism.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s a failure of <strong>open systems</strong>.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/steve_jobs_had_no_heart_attack_citizen_journalism_failed.php">Sarah Perez points out at ReadWriteWeb</a>, ANYONE can become a citizen journalist on iReport:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apparently, it&#8217;s as easy to become a citizen journalist on CNN as it is to sign up for a new web app from an internet startup, if not easier. The process involves nothing more than filling out a name, screen name, and email address. Adding a phone number is optional and only necessary if you want the story to be considered by CNN. There&#8217;s a CAPTCHA to prevent bots and an email confirmation link, but thanks to disposable email addresses, those are practically a waste of time these days.</p></blockquote>
<p><span id="more-1157"></span>&#8220;Citizens&#8221; &#8212; people who are not professional journalists &#8212; can use a platform like iReport to legitimately report news. Remember those eyewitness reports from the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/08/02/bridge.collapse.irpt/index.html">Minnesota bridge collapse</a>?</p>
<p>The problem is &#8212; and this is something that advocates of citizen journalism typically overlook &#8212; that if a platform is open, and anyone can participate, that means not only can well-intentioned citizens participate but so can bad actors, spammers, liars, cheats, and thieves.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the double-edged swords of open systems &#8212; you have to take the bad with the good. In fact, you have to EXPECT the bad with the good.  The ideology of open participation has revolutionized media, but that same ideology is often quite naive.</p>
<p>Someone posts a false report to a citizen journalism platform &#8212; I&#8217;m shocked, SHOCKED to find that gambling is going on in here!</p>
<p>Ask Google or Digg about the problem with open systems &#8212; heaven help you if you&#8217;re successful, because you will be consigned to waging a nonstop battle again spam and every imaginable type of malicious behavior.</p>
<p>When we first conceived of <a href="http://publish2.com">Publish2</a> as a platform exclusively for journalists, we worried that we would take a lot of flack for trying to define who a journalist is at a time when that definition is expanding. But we realized that our &#8220;velvet rope&#8221; is really about what we want to keep OUT, i.e. covert PR, undisclosed marketing, and SPAM. That&#8217;s why rather than a definition we opted for a set of <a href="http://www.publish2.com/about/editorial-standards">editorial standards</a>.</p>
<p>The issue with citizen journalism is not about who is qualified or smart enough to be a journalist. It&#8217;s about TRUST and TRANSPARENCY. It may not be brain surgery, but (dis)information in the wrong hands does have the potential to do real harm. There&#8217;s a reason why journalism has developed standards for reporting, sourcing, fact checking, and accuracy.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s because these standards protect people.</p>
<p>New organizations like CNN that have rolled out completely open systems should think carefully about the potential harm that can be done when they toss out editorial standards in the name of open participation.</p>
<p>iReport&#8217;s tagline is &#8220;Unedited. Unfiltered. News.&#8221; Yeah, well, throw in lies and spam and anything else besides &#8220;news&#8221; that &#8220;the people&#8221; want to throw in.</p>
<p>Saying anyone can participate in journalism doesn&#8217;t mean there should be no standards. And launching an unpoliced open system doesn&#8217;t mean it will always be used for anything that can fairly be called journalism.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>
<p>Instead of trying to host the citizen journalism, to OWN it, which is of course what traditional media organizations are designed to do, news sites should find the citizen journalism already being done on the ultimate open platform &#8212; the web. And when they find good reporting, and verify it according to journalistic standards, then they can LINK to it. So instead of creating an open spam platform, news sites will have created more connections on the web and elevated the link to form of news judgement.</p>
<p>But that actually requires a bit of effort. It&#8217;s so much easier to set up an open platform and let people run wild&#8230; until it blows up in your face and sucks value out of your news brand. Which is reckless, because trusted brands are news organization&#8217;s greatest assets.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an idea for news orgs &#8212; publish a how to video or screencast that teaches people in your community how to set up their own blog and report. And tell them that if they do good work, you&#8217;ll link to them and send them traffic. And guess what &#8212; they&#8217;ll link back to you. That&#8217;s the way the web works. That&#8217;s the beauty of the web.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://washingtonpost.com">washingtonpost.com</a> has launched a new politics page called <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/political-browser/">Political Browser</a>, which features, wait for it&#8230; links to the most important and interesting political news around the web. That&#8217;s right, the Washington Post, one of the paragons of original political reporting, has dedicated a page to help you find the best of OTHER news organization&#8217;s political reporting.</p>
<p>Crazy? Well, actually it makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>I spoke with Eric Pianin, the Politics Editor for washingtonpost.com, who explained that The Washington Post sees an opportunity to extend their highly respected politic news brand to filtering the political web.</p>
<p>And filtering is a BIG opportunity on the web.</p>
<p><span id="more-1146"></span>In fact, Political Browser was born of a determined effort by The Post to get into the news aggregation game. Eric told me that interest in news aggregation extends to the highest level of The Post&#8217;s senior leadership, including <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/07/AR2008020701162.html" target="_blank">Katharine </a><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/07/AR2008020701162.html" target="_blank">Weymouth</a> &#8212; they have been &#8220;fascinated&#8221; by the success of aggregation sites like Drudge, Huffington Post, Hotline, and others.</p>
<p>Eric acknowledged that washingtonpost.com is &#8220;late to the party,&#8221; but in fact the Political Browser puts the Post way out ahead of many other news sites &#8212; while many have begun to recognize the <a href="http://publishing2.com/2008/09/15/drudge-report-news-site-that-sends-readers-away-with-links-has-highest-engagement">value of aggregation and links</a>, most have been slow to act.</p>
<p>As Eric points out, it&#8217;s &#8220;not just aggregation.&#8221; (Heck, any algorithm can do aggregation &#8212; that&#8217;s increasingly a commodity.) What Political Browser has set out to do, according to Eric, is put The Washington Post &#8220;stamp of approval&#8221; on the choice of stories, and to provide &#8220;insight&#8221; into what&#8217;s important in the sphere of political news on the web.</p>
<p>Also looking beyond commodity aggregation, The Post believes, with good reason, that a lot people who are interested in political news and in the Post&#8217;s political reporting would find it interesting to get &#8220;inside the heads&#8221; of Post journalists, to see what they are reading and what is informing their reporting.</p>
<p>One of Political Browser&#8217;s features is literally called &#8220;<span class="trenchheader">WHAT STAFF WRITER MICHAEL ABRAMOWITZ IS READING TODAY&#8221;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://publishing2.com/images/political-browser-staff-picks.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1154" title="political-browser-staff-picks" src="http://publishing2.com/images/political-browser-staff-picks.jpg" alt="" width="355" height="422" /></a></p>
<p>What are E.J. Dionne, Eugene Robinson, and other Post journalists reading that&#8217;s informing their perspective? Political Browser is taking the Post down a path where we can find out.</p>
<p>Political Browser is about the &#8220;news judgment&#8221; of Post journalists &#8212; and isn&#8217;t that, at the end of the day, what reporting and editing have always been about?</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s the really intriguing news &#8212; Eric reports that Political Browser is generating a lot of interest among Washington Post editorial staff to take part in the news aggregation effort, to influence what stories get linked.</p>
<p>And it makes sense &#8212; what journalist wouldn&#8217;t want to tap into a new vehicle for influence? And The Post aims to make Political Browser a major influence in the political web.</p>
<p>Political Browser&#8217;s Required Reading section synthesizes the judgment of The Post&#8217;s politics staff about the most important political stories of the day:</p>
<p><a href="http://publishing2.com/images/political-browser-required-reading.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1155" title="political-browser-required-reading" src="http://publishing2.com/images/political-browser-required-reading.jpg" alt="" width="233" height="483" /></a></p>
<p>An essential feature of the Required Reading section are the brief comments that accompany each link. While the choice of stories is the core value, it&#8217;s The Post&#8217;s comments, summing up the significance of the story or adding perspective, that make Required Reading a unique and valuable editorial feature. It&#8217;s like a mini link blog &#8212; something that every news site should be doing on all of their topic pages. (Something that every journalist, really, should be doing.)</p>
<p>Required Reading may include a link to a Post story, but not necessarily &#8212; and that makes the feature an honest broker, avoiding conflict of interest with The Post&#8217;s own original content.</p>
<p>There is a section, Best of The Post, that exclusively links to Post political stories, but even this feature is groundbreaking in its own way. Most topic pages on news sites display a laundry list of ALL content. Here, the Post applies the same filter to its own content, helping to prioritize your reading.</p>
<p><a href="http://publishing2.com/images/political-browser-best-of-the-post.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1153" title="political-browser-best-of-the-post" src="http://publishing2.com/images/political-browser-best-of-the-post.jpg" alt="" width="232" height="330" /></a></p>
<p>The anchor of the Political Browser is The Takeaway, written by Ben Pershing &#8212; as Eric describes it a &#8220;clever, breezy, irreverent, but highly informed&#8221; look at the most important stories and buzz on the campaign trail.</p>
<p><a href="http://publishing2.com/images/political-browser-the-takeway.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1149" title="political-browser-the-takeway" src="http://publishing2.com/images/political-browser-the-takeway.jpg" alt="" width="354" height="484" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a classic link blog, featuring plenty of links and attitude, and serves, as Eric points out, as a complement to the Post&#8217;s other successful political blogs.</p>
<p>Work on The Takeaway begins at 8 a.m. with a first post and extends throughout the day as political news evolves and breaks.</p>
<p>Political Browser has a further assortment of short, punchy link features, such as Trench Warfare, with links to stories and commentary from the left and right.</p>
<p><a href="http://publishing2.com/images/political-browser-trench-warfare.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1150" title="political-browser-trench-warfare" src="http://publishing2.com/images/political-browser-trench-warfare.jpg" alt="" width="354" height="258" /></a></p>
<p>There&#8217;s also Blunder Box, i.e. &#8220;gotcha journalism&#8221; as Eric describes it with tongue in cheek &#8212; but it&#8217;s done with a link, so that means the blunder is already out there (e.g. this McCain ad declaring victory in the debate, which ran before the debate), so it&#8217;s not really a gotcha in the sense that journalists are typically accused.</p>
<p><a href="http://publishing2.com/images/political-browser-blunder-box.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1147" title="political-browser-blunder-box" src="http://publishing2.com/images/political-browser-blunder-box.jpg" alt="" width="354" height="162" /></a></p>
<p>The effort to compile links for Political Browser begins around 6 a.m. and by 8 a.m. a fresh page is up. Currently, the process involves emailing journalists to see if they have any additional links to contribute. It&#8217;s a tremendous step forward that The Post has begun developing an <strong>editorial workflow</strong> for links, which most newsrooms lack, so that they <a href="http://publishing2.com/2008/08/07/how-newsrooms-throw-away-value-by-not-linking-to-sources-on-the-web">don&#8217;t lose the value of what reporters and editors are already finding</a> in their daily reading.</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s where technology could give The Post a competitive advantage in the developing their editorial workflow. <a href="http://www.publish2.com/">A web-based editorial system for links</a> could optimize this workflow and make it easier for journalists in the newsroom to contribute links, and for Political Browser editors to edit and publish those links. Imagine getting the entire Post newsroom set up to do <a href="http://www.publish2.com/about/what-is-link-journalism">link journalism</a>, to contribute dynamically to the news aggregation effort.</p>
<p>The big opportunity for The Post in leveraging web technology is efficiently tapping into the collective intelligence of ALL of their journalists. Sites like Digg have demonstrated what a powerful and dynamic filter can be created using social web technology to enable people to collaborate on filtering the web. Imagine dynamically connecting the news judgment of the entire Post newsroom &#8212; tapping into <a href="http://blog.publish2.com/2008/02/29/how-networked-link-journalism-can-give-journalists-collectively-the-power-of-google-and-digg/">editorial network effects among journalists</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s still so much untapped potential in news aggregation, and The Post is ideally positioned to realize that potential.</p>
<p>Political Browser is only about a week into its new life, so it&#8217;s too early to talk about traffic or other such measures of success. But the Post is committed to testing how well they can build an audience for news aggregation and link journalism. And the commitment to experiment is one of the most notable features of Political Browser. These days, all innovation in the news business is experimental by definition. Eric says that they don&#8217;t know yet now Political Browser will evolve, which actually increases the chances that it will evolve into an even greater innovation.</p>
<p>Still, attempting to build an audience for a page of links, as an influential destination, feels like a <a href="http://publishing2.com/2008/09/17/why-every-news-site-should-put-a-continuously-updated-news-aggregation-on-the-homepage/">good bet to be making on the web</a>.</p>
<p>One immediate response The Post has seen is other news sites getting in touch to discuss reciprocal linking deals. Of course, linking in the form of &#8220;deal&#8221; drains a good deal of the editorial value &#8212; in fact, you might argue that such arrangements compromise the editorial independence of the link journalism. If Political Browser links to <a href="http://poiitico.com">Politico</a>, you want to know it&#8217;s because the Browser&#8217;s editors think the story is worth reading&#8230; not because Politico is linking back.</p>
<p>What would be much more interesting is an open editorial system for exchanging links, where sites could get links to their content on other sites based on editorial merit rather than deal making. Think of it like a <a href="http://blog.publish2.com/2008/09/03/publish2-the-webs-newswire/">newswire for links</a>.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s most radical about Political Browser is that the Washington Post has committed to creating significant value with their editorial brand beyond their core mission of original reporting.</p>
<p>But how better to unlock the value of The Post&#8217;s brand on the web than to apply human editorial judgment to the challenge of filtering the web? Algorithms can beat humans at comprehensive web search, but humans should be able to beat algorithms at news aggregation.</p>
<p>And I would argue that the links on Political Browser are a <a href="http://www.publish2.com/about/what-is-link-journalism">form of journalism</a> &#8212; and that news aggregation and filtering the web will be an essential function of news organizations going forward.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://ajr.org/Article.asp?id=4605">Philip Meyer observed in AJR</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The old hunter-gatherer model of journalism is no longer sufficient. Now that information is so plentiful, we don&#8217;t need new information so much as help in processing what&#8217;s already available. Just as the development of modern agriculture led to a demand for varieties of processed food, the information age has created a demand for processed information. We need someone to put it into context, give it theoretical framing and suggest ways to act on it.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8220;we don&#8217;t need new information so much as help in processing what&#8217;s already available&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a radical idea, still, for many news organizations. But not for The Washington Post &#8212; they are aiming to excel at BOTH, at the original reporting that surfaces essential new information AND at processing the information that&#8217;s already available.</p>
<p>Of course, filtering the web with links is not really a radical idea for the thousands of journalists who read <a href="http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=45">Romensko</a> every day or who chase after links on Drudge.</p>
<p>They just need the courage to try it themselves.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yeah, fine, so <a href="http://publishing2.com/2008/09/15/drudge-report-news-site-that-sends-readers-away-with-links-has-highest-engagement/">Drudge gets lots of traffic for links</a>, but we&#8217;re not Drudge, so it won&#8217;t work for our news site, right? Wrong. Here&#8217;s a case example from <a href="http://knoxnews.com">Knoxnews.com&#8217;s</a> sports site <a href="http://GoVolsXtra.com">GoVolsXtra.com</a>.</p>
<p>This <a href="http://www.govolsxtra.com/news/2008/sep/22/coverage-roundup-fall-begins-discontent-vol-fans/">roundup of links to coverage and commentary</a> on the Vols&#8217; loss to Florida was the MOST VIEWED article today on GoVolsXtra.com.</p>
<p><a href="http://publishing2.com/images/govolsxtra-coverage-roundup.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1140" title="govolsxtra-coverage-roundup" src="http://publishing2.com/images/govolsxtra-coverage-roundup.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="592" /></a></p>
<p>You could explain the page view count in one of two ways (or both). First, lots of fans like these roundups, and seek them out when they appear as a story on the homepage. Or, people clicked on a link, then came back for more, generating more page views.</p>
<p>Either way, a win.</p>
<p><span id="more-1137"></span>But what about ENGAGEMENT?</p>
<p><a href="http://publishing2.com/images/govolsxtra-hot-comments.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1144" title="govolsxtra-hot-comments" src="http://publishing2.com/images/govolsxtra-hot-comments.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="593" /></a></p>
<p>Well, last time I looked there were <strong>168 comments</strong>!</p>
<p><a href="http://publishing2.com/images/govolsxtra-roundup-comments.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1143" title="govolsxtra-roundup-comments" src="http://publishing2.com/images/govolsxtra-roundup-comments.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="437" /></a></p>
<p>And the article was on the most commented list for the site. (The coverage roundup story is the only one on the most commented list published today &#8212; the rest are from the weekend.)</p>
<p><a href="http://publishing2.com/images/govolsxtra-most-commented.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1142" title="govolsxtra-most-commented" src="http://publishing2.com/images/govolsxtra-most-commented.jpg" alt="" width="338" height="245" /></a></p>
<p>So what does that mean?</p>
<p>By rounding up all of the coverage from around the web using LINKS, Knoxnews created a DESTINATION for fans to discuss the game.</p>
<p>And not just that&#8230; GoVolsXtra had more comments than any of the other sites the roundup articled linked to (combined, it appears).</p>
<p>So, linking works.</p>
<p>And you&#8217;re not doing it&#8230; why?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I happened to visit Facebook&#8217;s <a href="http://www.facebook.com/business/">Business Solutions</a> page, and was struck by how, at least on the surface, these advertising formats seem like exactly the kind of innovation that should be helping Facebook achieve Goolge-style revenue &#8212; which is of course what Facebook&#8217;s $15 billion valuation assumes will happen.</p>
<p><a href="http://publishing2.com/images/facebook-business-solutions.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1135" title="facebook-business-solutions" src="http://publishing2.com/images/facebook-business-solutions.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="328" /></a></p>
<p>And yet with 100 MILLION users, Facebook&#8217;s 2008 revenue was only <a href="http://kara.allthingsd.com/20080131/chatty-zuckerberg-tells-all-about-facebook-finances/">projected to be $300 million</a>. (The number may higher, haven&#8217;t seen, but it would be big news if it was much higher.)</p>
<p>Can you imagine a traditional media company with 100 MILLION viewers/readers/subscribers and only $300 million in revenue?</p>
<p><span id="more-1134"></span>Which leads to the question that should be on the mind of every media executive, from startups to big legacy players:</p>
<p><strong>Why isn&#8217;t Facebook making more money?</strong></p>
<p>Thinking about that question, I went over to Google&#8217;s <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/ads/">Advertising Solutions</a> page to compare the way AdWords is described to the way Facebook&#8217;s offerings are described.</p>
<p><a href="http://publishing2.com/images/google-adwords.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1136" title="google-adwords" src="http://publishing2.com/images/google-adwords.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="433" /></a></p>
<p>So let&#8217;s compare Google&#8217;s value proposition with Facebook&#8217;s:</p>
<p>Google says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Reach people actively looking for information about your products and services online</p></blockquote>
<p>Facebook says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Promote your website or Facebook Page with highly-targeted advertising. Make your ads even more effective by attaching them to News Feed stories about the users&#8217; friends.</p>
<p>Allow your customers to share with their friends the actions they take on your website.</p>
<p>Connect with your customers on Facebook similar to the way they connect with their friends.</p></blockquote>
<p>With Google you can reach people who are looking for precisely what you have to offer.</p>
<p>With Facebook you can insert your ad into news about peoples&#8217; friends. You can let people share their shopping habits with their friends. And you can, as a company/brand, be &#8220;friends&#8221; with your consumers.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the key difference between Google&#8217;s value proposition and Facebook&#8217;s?</p>
<p>With Google, the value to users and the value to advertisers is perfectly aligned. Everybody wins.</p>
<p>With Facebook, if you read between the lines, it&#8217;s really the same value proposition as traditional advertising &#8212; advertisers forcing themselves on users, in a way that creates little or no value for the users.</p>
<p>How many Facebook users have a burning need to find ads in their friends&#8217; newsfeeds? Or share their shopping habits? Or make friends with brands?</p>
<p>On Google, when you search for something, the adds are a form of search result &#8212; i.e. something you asked for, that you opted in to receive.</p>
<p>On Facebook, the ads, despite all the innovation, still aren&#8217;t something users are really asking for.</p>
<p>Is it possible on the web to have a more perfect alignment between advertiser and user value than search advertising?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know, but it seems a pretty safe bet that Facebook&#8217;s ad formats aren&#8217;t it.</p>
<p>(And pre-roll video advertising sure as heck ain&#8217;t it.  Could there be anything more antithetical to the fundamental web experience in the broadband era than having to wait 15 seconds to access the content you&#8217;re trying to load?)</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in media in the web era, you&#8217;d better be working on a business model that creates huge value for users. Either that, or be content to have a small business by traditional media standards.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The front page of the newspaper used to set the news agenda. Extra, Extra, read all about it! But that influence has steadily waned through the TV and Cable News era, and the web now threatens to obliterate it entirely.</p>
<p>So who sets the news agenda now? One significant influence is a guy with nothing but a page full of links (you know, the kind that &#8220;send people away&#8221;).</p>
<p>In a post the other day, <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2008/09/drudge-ology_101_softening_tow.html">Washington Post&#8217;s Chris Cillizza called Drudge</a> &#8220;the single most influential source for how the presidential campaign is covered in the country.&#8221;</p>
<p><span id="more-1133"></span>That&#8217;s quite a claim. Chris adds in a parenthetical:</p>
<blockquote><p>A quick note to preempt the inevitable argument that Drudge&#8217;s influence is overblown. Tomorrow morning, take a minute to look at the stories Drudge is highlighting. Then, later in the day, watch a few cable channels to see what stories they are talking about. It will open your eyes.</p></blockquote>
<p>As to the particulars:</p>
<blockquote><p>The increase in positive McCain stories featured on Drudge has coincided with more skeptical coverage of Obama&#8217;s candidacy. In recent weeks, Drudge has featured in his center well spot: A picture of <a href="http://www.drudgereportarchives.com/data/2008/09/08/20080908_234154.htm">Obama shooting at a far off basketball hoop</a> with a subtitle asking &#8220;Will he get his groove back?&#8221;; an <a href="http://www.drudgereportarchives.com/data/2008/09/08/20080908_140504.htm">image of Obama sweating on stage at the Democratic National Convention during the Illinois senator&#8217;s acceptance speech; and </a><a href="http://www.drudgereportarchives.com/data/2008/09/10/20080910_011731.htm">heavy coverage</a> of the &#8220;lipstick on a pig&#8221; comments.</p></blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, <a href="http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/09/overstating_drudges_influence.php">Greg Sargent over at Talking Points Memo took issue</a> with Chris&#8217; example of Drudge&#8217;s influence:</p>
<blockquote><p>This strikes us as an unfortunate example, particularly in a column arguing (as Cillizza does) that the source of Drudge&#8217;s power lies in his influence over the cable networks. Because one of the stories ignored by Drudge actually got a whole lot more coverage on cable yesterday than the one Drudge pushed all day in that supposedly hypnotic banner headline of his.</p></blockquote>
<p>But Greg&#8217;s push back is on the particulars, not the question of whether Drudge influences the news agenda at all:</p>
<blockquote><p>Look, far be it from me to question the notion that Drudge has influence over network producers. Of course he does. But if we&#8217;re really going to devote so much time to flacking Drudge&#8217;s influence, how about a real and nuanced discussion of it?</p></blockquote>
<p>And he adds at the end:</p>
<blockquote><p>If Drudge is going to consume our attention, how about a real discussion of Drudge and what the Drudge phenomenon says about the journalism profession &#8212; one that goes beyond the narrow question of how influential he is?</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed, I agree the pertinent question is not the magnitude of Drudge&#8217;s influence. The real question is: WHY is Drudge influential at all, when all he does is link to news?</p>
<p>The answer is that Drudge, along with Google, figured out that in the web media era, when all news content is accessible by anyone, anywhere in the world, and no news brands no longer have a monopoly over news distribution, the power of influence lies in the ability to FILTER the vast sea of news.</p>
<p>Newspapers were once THE most important filters for news. But they gave up this role on the web, because they didn&#8217;t see that the web analogue to what they did on the front page in print was NOT taking the same content and putting it on a website front page. In fact, you could argue that this is the single biggest mistake that newspapers have made on the web.</p>
<p>What they failed to see is that the web analogue to the newspaper front page is LINKS to where the news IS. That&#8217;s Drudge.</p>
<p>The web is about CONNECTIONS, and newspaper website front pages don&#8217;t connect anything to anything. That&#8217;s why they have so little influence.</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s a hard truth about the current newspaper web strategy: Focusing exclusively on local isn&#8217;t going to bring back the influence of the newspaper front page.</p>
<p>Newspapers can&#8217;t just set the local news agenda. They have to set the WEB news agenda.</p>
<p>So while newspapers focus on new modes of content &#8212; video, audio, photos, interactive graphics &#8212; they are missing the BIG opportunity on the web.  The opportunity to regain their position of influence.</p>
<p>And newspapers won&#8217;t regain that position of influence by hosting more content, whether it&#8217;s multimedia or user-generated.</p>
<p>Yes, any one piece of content can be very influential, but systemically, content is not the source of influence on the web.  (Think about that for a while.)</p>
<p><a href="http://publishing2.com/2008/01/28/influentials-on-the-web-are-people-with-the-power-to-link/">LINKS = Influence on the web.</a></p>
<p>If newspapers want to regain their influence, they have to focus on LINKS.</p>
<p>The web, after all, isn&#8217;t really about content. It&#8217;s about connections between content, people, and ideas.</p>
<p>So before anyone in the newsroom gets trained on Flash or databases or digital video, they should receive the most fundamental training that anyone who works on the web MUST understand:</p>
<p><strong>How to link.</strong></p>
<p>You know, &lt;a href=&#8221;WHERE THE NEWS IS</p>
<p>Is there ANY newsroom out there that trains their staff how to link? (If so, please <a href="http://publishing2.com/author/scott-karp/">get in touch</a>.)</p>
<p>The lessons of <a href="http://publishing2.com/2008/01/28/influentials-on-the-web-are-people-with-the-power-to-link/">how to be influential on the web</a> have been <a href="http://publishing2.com/2008/09/15/drudge-report-news-site-that-sends-readers-away-with-links-has-highest-engagement/">around for a decade</a>.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it finally time to learn them?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scott framed his <a title="previous challenge" href="http://publishing2.com/2008/09/17/why-every-news-site-should-put-a-continuously-updated-news-aggregation-on-the-homepage" target="_blank">previous challenge</a> to news sites in general terms: like Drudge, any site could use continuously updated aggregation to become a &#8220;destination for links to news of what&#8217;s going in the world.&#8221; But this kind of aggregation can be just as powerful when applied to specific stories or topics.</p>
<p>For example, you might have noticed that the U.S. financial system seems to be &#8212; how to put this delicately? &#8212; <a title="collapsing" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/18/business/18markets.html?hp" target="_blank">collapsing</a>. Most readers (and, um, journalists) probably have only the faintest idea of what the heck is going on. Yet this is one case where many people would love some <a title="broccoli news" href="http://blog.publish2.com/2008/09/09/how-links-can-solve-newspapers-broccoli-problem-aka-the-nude-britney-ipod-conundrum/" target="_blank">broccoli news</a>, if only it made sense to them.</p>
<p>News sites could help explain the crisis by putting up a continuously updated aggregation of links to the best reporting and commentary. Some sites may already have bloggers linking to these stories, but why not put the links right on the front page? With things as tense and confusing as they are, we shouldn&#8217;t make readers hunt for context.<br />
<span id="more-1128"></span></p>
<p>Journalists could find these stories individually, or they could leverage the power of a <a title="network" href="http://publishing2.com/2008/09/03/publish2-the-webs-newswire" target="_blank">network</a> to find and share links with other journalists and newsrooms.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve created a <a title="Newsgroup" href="http://www.publish2.com/newsgroups/financial-crisis" target="_blank">Financial Crisis Newsgroup</a> on Publish2 to do just that. Any journalist on <a href="http://publish2.com">Publish2</a> can join the group (email me at josh dot korr [at] publish2 dot com if you&#8217;re interested), and any news organization can publish those links on its site.</p>
<p>Here are some links from the Newsgroup:</p>
<div id="publish2-feed">
<blockquote>
<p class="publish2-story"><a class="publish2-link publish2-story-headline" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2200299/">Where did the government get $85 billion to bail out AIG?</a><br />
<span class="publish2-story-description">A Slate explainer answers a good question: &#8220;Does the government really have a spare $85 billion lying around just in case?&#8221;</span></p>

<span class="publish2-story-description">David Leonhardt offers a diagnosis of the crisis: &#8220;Regulators, starting with Alan Greenspan, assumed that a real estate bubble couldn’t happen and that Wall Street could largely police itself. And households, struggling with incomes that haven’t kept up with inflation in recent years, said yes when those lightly regulated banks offered them wishful-thinking loans. No bailout can solve either problem.&#8221; He also suggests some solutions.</span></p>
<p class="publish2-story"><a class="publish2-link publish2-story-headline" href="http://blogmaverick.com/2008/09/15/stock-market-meltdowns-why-they-will-happen-again-and-again-and-again/">Stock Market Meltdowns &#8211; Why they will happen again and again and again</a><br />
<span class="publish2-story-description">Some smart thoughts from Mark Cuban on how the imbalance between risk and reward for CEOs helped precipitate the crisis. Cuban has a great suggestion for a new law: &#8220;If the government must step in and provide any sort of financing or guarantees for any part of a public company’s business, then all officers and directors lose all rights to severance pay and all outstanding vested or unvested options or warrants immediately become canceled.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="publish2-story"><a class="publish2-link publish2-story-headline" href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/09/fingers-in-the.html">Americans confront economic reality</a><br />
<span class="publish2-story-description">Andrew Sullivan&#8217;s take on the financial crisis: &#8220;To my mind, what is happening now in the economy is the same as what happened in Iraq after the invasion. The denial of the American people of the reality of the world they live in has finally caught up with them.&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t require days of planning or hours of overtime. When Scott wrote about the <a title="pace of innovation" href="http://blog.publish2.com/2008/02/10/the-pace-of-innovation-in-journalism/" target="_blank">pace of innovation</a> in journalism earlier this year, he mentioned a 48-hour experiment. That&#8217;s horse-and-buggy speed by now.</p>
<p>You could set up a Newsgroup, seed it with some links, and publish the links on your site in <em>15 minutes</em> (okay &#8212; maybe add an hour to get a few colleagues to join in). Adding subsequent links takes all of two mouse clicks.</p>
<p>News sites should of course experiment with more general-topic aggregation, a la Drudge. But when stories unfold as jarringly fast as the Wall Street meltdown, continuously updated aggregation could be a huge help for readers who are grasping for understanding.</p>
<p>And if you do this for a couple of major stories, the next time a big one breaks they&#8217;ll know where to turn for answers first.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My post on <a href="http://publishing2.com/2008/09/15/drudge-report-news-site-that-sends-readers-away-with-links-has-highest-engagement/">Drudge beating all other news sites on engagement</a> was an aha for many, which is interesting because the lesson of Drudge has been around for a decade. But the lessons of web publishing are all so utterly counterintuitive that I suppose they take a while to sink in.</p>
<p>That said, a number of commenters took issue with the conclusion that Drudge&#8217;s engagement metrics are meaningful, and that there are any useful lessons for other news sites.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to respond by upping the ante &#8212; I think the lesson of Drudge is that every news site should put a continuously updated aggregation of links on their homepage.</p>
<p><span id="more-1126"></span>Here&#8217;s how the argument to my original post went. Several commenters, including  <a href="http://publishing2.com/2008/09/15/drudge-report-news-site-that-sends-readers-away-with-links-has-highest-engagement/#comment-543040">Ian Lamont from The Industry Standard pointed out</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The auto-refresh rate (about once every three minutes, I believe) throws a wrench into comparisons with other sites that don’t auto-refresh. Some advertisers and outsiders may be impressed by Drudge’s high pv/visit numbers, but those are inflated by people who keep their Drudge window open while visiting links in other tabs.</p></blockquote>
<p>To which I responded:</p>
<blockquote><p>What news site wouldn’t want to be open in a reader’s browser being refreshed all day?</p></blockquote>
<p>And then I asked:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why can’t news sites be a destination for original content AND links?”</p></blockquote>
<p>To which <a href="http://publishing2.com/2008/09/15/drudge-report-news-site-that-sends-readers-away-with-links-has-highest-engagement/#comment-543289">Tim Buden responded</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Because they perform two essentially different functions. One is a destination, one is a starting point. You’re simply not going to get the same behaviour.</p>
<p>People go to a story page on some news content site after having found the link on some aggregator or portal. They do not hang around on the news site’s front page, refreshing the page and hoping for new links.</p>
<p>And while outbound links on the story page may well be useful, they’re not going to hang out on that page hoping for new links on the story either. That’s a job for aggregators.</p></blockquote>
<p>And that&#8217;s when the lightbulb went on.</p>
<p><strong>Most new sites are at the wrong end of the value chain. </strong></p>
<p>Most news site are just a bunch of individual content pages that people land on FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE and where they quickly leave to go SOMEWHERE ELSE.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Google derives more economic value on the web than any other media company &#8212; because Google figured out how to be the starting point. And they did it by offering the WHOLE web, not just a tiny slice of it.</p>
<p>Most news sites offer a tiny slice of the web, which consists of their own content.</p>
<p>Aggregators offer the WHOLE web.</p>
<p>Most news sites &#8212; in fact, most content sites &#8212; are just a brief stopping point as users surf the web, neither a beginning nor an end.</p>
<p>I read NYTimes.come every day, but I only visit it once or twice a day, because unless there is breaking news, the homepage doesn&#8217;t really change much. There&#8217;s no reason to go back.</p>
<p>But just because NYTimes.com has no new content on its homepage doesn&#8217;t mean news on the web is standing still.</p>
<p>In contrast, I visit <a href="http://techmeme.com">Techmeme</a> multiple times per day, because there is ALWAYS new news. In fact, I visit NYTimnes.com more often via a link on Techmeme than I do going to NYTimes.com directly.</p>
<p>And then there are the hundreds of news sites that I visit ONLY when a site like Techmeme or Google sends me there. But I won&#8217;t go back to these sites until I get sent there again. But I&#8217;ll ALWAYS go back to Techmeme or Google.</p>
<p>OK, so here comes the really counterintuitive part &#8212; a news site does NOT have to choose between being a pass-through  content publisher and a starting point aggregator.</p>
<p>A news site can be BOTH.</p>
<p>Imagine if the NYTimes.com put above the fold on its homepage a continously updated list of links to breaking news around the web &#8212; and then set the homepage to auto-refresh, like Drudge and Techmeme.</p>
<p>Instead of checking NYTimes.com once or twice a day, I&#8217;d probably start checking it constantly&#8230; obsessively.</p>
<p>And each time I came&#8230; I&#8217;d notice any new NYT content, along with new links.</p>
<p>Or what if WashingtonPost.com did the same thing? Instead of going to NYTimes.com by default, I&#8217;d probably go to WashingtonPost.com&#8230; and NYTimes.com would become just one of the many places that WashingtonPost.com sent me.</p>
<p>Or&#8230; what if, Newsweek.com, for example, created this destination for links to news of what&#8217;s going in the world? Maybe I&#8217;d stop going to either the Post or the Times, because Newsweek would send me to the best stories from both sites&#8230; and many more.</p>
<p>Or&#8230; what if the Post&#8217;s <a href="http://loudounextra.washingtonpost.com/">LoudounExtra</a> local site did the national/international news aggregation. Then I could find out what&#8217;s going on in the world &#8212; from ALL the best sources on the web &#8212; AND find out what&#8217;s going on in my community, all in one place.</p>
<p>Bottom line is&#8230; I&#8217;ll ALWAYS go back to the site that constantly updates with links. It&#8217;s the way I can derive the most value from the web as a news source.</p>
<p>New sites need to ask themselves &#8212; how can we create the most value for news consumers on the web? The evidence is pretty darn clear.</p>
<p>So is anybody going to take my advice? The problem is what I&#8217;m suggesting runs so completely counter to traditional publishing that many editors would literally have to put their heads on backwards in order to devote a portion of their homepages to news aggregation.</p>
<p>But I still hold out hope the newspaper editors, for example, will come to the realization that in print they are already in the aggregation business &#8212; but on the web, they are merely in the content business.</p>
<p>And on the web, as in print, all the economic value is in the aggregation business.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://publish2.com">tools exist</a> for newsrooms to collaborate in creating a continuously updated news aggregation on the homepage &#8212; all that&#8217;s required is for a news site to decide it makes both editorial and economic sense to be in the aggregation business, to be a starting point for news.</p>
<p>P.S. Just for kicks, here&#8217;s the latest <a href="http://www.drudgereport.com/hit.pdf">Hitwise ranking for news sites</a> &#8212; check out Drudge&#8217;s market share:</p>
<p><a href="http://publishing2.com/images/hitwise-news-site-rankings.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1127" title="hitwise-news-site-rankings" src="http://publishing2.com/images/hitwise-news-site-rankings-300x88.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="88" /></a></p>
<p>P. P. S. It just occurred to me after posting this why Drudge has such a huge audience &#8212; because Drudge has NO COMPETITION!</p>
<p>Geesh. You&#8217;d think some highly trusted traditional news brand would roll up their sleaves and take on Drudge.</p>
