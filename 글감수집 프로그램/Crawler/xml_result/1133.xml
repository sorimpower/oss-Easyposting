<p><strong>By Laura McClure, Emily McManus and Kate Torgovnick May</strong></p>
<p>Big data is already transforming our daily lives. And at TED@IBM, a <a href="https://www.ted.com/about/programs-initiatives/ted-institute">TED Institute event</a>, we got a glimpse of what’s next. Speakers revealed how data will change spaces from the kitchen to the emergency room, and how it will even help us react more quickly to the next ebola-scale epidemic. Throughout the day echoed the message that, for the technologists creating this new future, it is both a tremendous opportunity as well as a big responsibility.<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>Below, some choice words from each of the TED@IBM talks:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">“There is no business-to-business, there’s no business-to-consumer, there is only human-to-human. You don’t sell to a brand, you sell to a person. People identify with human experience, with human conversation.”</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">—<a href="http://www.ibm.com/social-business/us/en/ted/#overlay_bryan"><b>Bryan Kramer</b></a><b>, CEO of Pure Matter</b>, who spoke on the importance of sharing. He asked viewers to tweet their own idea using the hashtag #SharingInspires, and it trended on Twitter.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">“Today in the ICU, medical teams are bombarded with data and noise. Nearly 150 million data points and over 1,300 alarms are generated per day by <i>one</i> patient &#8230; and 90% of those alarms are completely inactionable. Machines and analytics don’t replace humans. They empower the medical staff to focus their highly skilled attention on the things that matter in the moment.”</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">—<a href="http://www.ibm.com/social-business/us/en/ted/#overlay_inhi"><b>Inhi Cho Suh</b></a><b>, </b><b>Vice President of Big Data Integration and Governance for IBM Software Group</b>, who spoke on how data can lead to better healthcare</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">“Imagine a world where, no matter how far you live from an electricity grid or a pump station, you will have access to clean power, heating, refrigeration, drinkable water and even gasoline. Now, imagine that this technology can do it using everyday materials like concrete, reflective aluminum foil and air &#8212; plus the ultra-high-efficiency solar cells used in satellites.”</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">—<a href="http://www.ibm.com/social-business/us/en/ted/#overlay_gianluca"><b>Gianluca Ambrosetti</b></a><b>, Head of Research for Airlight Energy</b>, which seeks to bring solar energy to remote parts of the planet using sunflower-shaped panels.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">“An algorithm spotted the ebola outbreak nine days before the Word Health Organization recognized it. We could have put simple measures in effect to contain that disease early on. … One abundant, renewable resource can make our aid efforts more effective: the flood of big data and our capacity to make sense of it like never before. We can now forecast the next humanitarian healthcare crisis.”</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">—<a href="http://www.ibm.com/social-business/us/en/ted/#overlay_monika"><b>Monika Blaumueller</b></a><b>, </b><b>consultant at IBM</b>, who spoke on how data can super-size humanitarian aid</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">“Why does tone matter? Tone reflects our intent, our frame of mind and our emotion. Tone is instinctive, but setting the right tone takes work &#8230; Tone can inspire and guide, or disrupt and hurt.”</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">—<a href="http://www.ibm.com/social-business/us/en/ted/#overlay_kareem"><b>Kareem Yusuf</b></a><b>, of </b><b>IBM&#8217;s Smarter Commerce initiative</b>, who spoke about how businesses must think carefully about the tone they set with customers in the digital landscape</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">“A growing number of Americans work, play and live with people who think exactly like them &#8212; but opportunity makers actively seek friendships and experiences with those who are different from them. Some of our most valuable allies are people who don’t act or think at all like us. ”</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">—<a href="http://www.ibm.com/social-business/us/en/ted/#overlay_kare"><b>Kare Anderson</b></a><b>, </b><b>columnist for </b><b><i>Forbes</i></b>, who spoke on the three traits that opportunity makers have in common</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">“We often hear that movies are dead or dying. I don’t believe the cinema is dying, but I do believe it’s wounded from a million paper cuts. When movies are done right, they are magic. There are two things that a cinema has that you never get at home. One, a screen the size of Cleveland. Two, the magic of the room watching it, where there sits a dream shared with a one-time-only mix of strangers, a gold mine of emotions waiting to collide in the dark. People come to movies ready to dream, and that’s a resource that’s too precious to squander.”</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">—<a href="http://www.ibm.com/social-business/us/en/ted/#overlay_brad"><b>Brad Bird</b></a><b>, Academy Award-winning director</b>, who spoke on how filmmakers can keep capturing that magic</p>
<div id="attachment_92005" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-92005" src="http://tedconfblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/tedibm_0921.jpg?w=900&#038;h=599" alt="Kareem Photo: Marla Aufmuth/TED" width="900" height="599" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Kareem Yusuf shared the story of how he was able to bridge two very different working environments by striking the right tone. Photo: Marla Aufmuth/TED</p></div>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">“When my oldest daughter was three, she had to have tubes in her ears. The surgeon at the hospital told us they scheduled those operations on Tuesdays and Thursdays, on the same days of some of the most difficult adult procedures. Following those surgeries, the kids recover in a large and common recovery room – alongside the adults. Why? Because the adults recover faster when exposed to small children who are also recovering &#8230; Through emotional analytics we can better understand why that is the case, and re-create that positive experience for a whole range of patients.”</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">—<a href="http://www.ibm.com/social-business/us/en/ted/#overlay_erick"><b>Erick Brethenoux</b></a><b>, </b><b>of IBM’s Business Analytics Division</b>, who spoke on what we can learn from emotional analytics</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">“People weren’t meant to live forever. With each generation, we don’t just pass along our DNA—we pass along our ideas. The innovations we uncover today become the building blocks for innovation for future generations.”</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><i>—</i><a href="http://www.ibm.com/social-business/us/en/ted/#overlay_lisa"><b>Lisa Seacat DeLuca</b></a><b>, </b><b>mobile software engineer for IBM’s Open Technology and Cloud Performance organization</b>, who spoke on the “Internet of Everything”</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">“We’re bombarded with stories about how much data there is in the world &#8230; Much of our data doesn’t fit neatly into databases. It is highly subjective &#8230; Data doesn’t create meaning. We do &#8230; So we have to ask, ‘Did the data really show us this? Or does the conclusion make us feel more comfortable and successful?’”</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">—<a href="http://www.ibm.com/social-business/us/en/ted/#overlay_susan"><b>Susan Etlinger</b></a><b>, i</b><b>ndustry analyst with Altimeter Group</b>, who spoke on the incredible responsibility that comes with interpreting data<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">“Can computers understand ingredient availability, as well as personal tastes and dietary constraints? Identify flavorful ingredient pairings? Help us create dishes that are healthy, taste good, and have never been seen before? &#8230; Cognitive cooking has the potential to redefine how we choose what to cook and eat. Instead of following existing recipes, cooks can create personalized recipes on the fly.”</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">—<a href="http://www.ibm.com/social-business/us/en/ted/#overlay_florian"><b>Florian Pinel</b></a><b>, </b><b>Senior Software Engineer in the IBM Watson</b> <b>Group</b>, who spoke about the potential of Chef Watson</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">“At some point, parents have to trust their teenagers. People who successfully parent teens into adulthood eventually tell them, ‘I know you can do this on your own.’ It’s time for us to learn how do this at work as well &#8230; Leaders today need to trust that their employees have the information, experience and good judgment to make decisions that in the past would have been sent ‘up the ladder.’”</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">—<a href="http://www.ibm.com/social-business/us/en/ted/#overlay_charlene"><b>Charlene Li</b></a><b>, </b><b>CEO of the </b><a href="http://www.altimetergroup.com/"><b>Altimeter Group</b></a><b>, </b>who spoke about the topic of her bestselling-book, <i>Open Leadership</i></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><b>“</b>As more and more of our lives are captured in digital, the insights that can be generated by big data analytics will become increasingly impactful. As a society we can choose to let these insights be used as a force for good or evil; to exploit individuals or enrich their lives. Our approach to privacy will have the single greatest impact on that outcome.”</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">—<a href="http://www.ibm.com/social-business/us/en/ted/#overlay_marie"><b>Marie Wallace</b></a><b>, </b><b>Analytics Strategist for IBM and creator of the blog </b><a href="http://www.allthingsanalytics.com/"><b>All Things Analytics</b></a>, who spoke on the importance of privacy</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">“For the most part, we only study brains when there is something wrong with them &#8230; This technology allows us to study brains in conditions and contexts that are as diverse as those of everyday life.”</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><strong>—<a href="http://www.ibm.com/social-business/us/en/ted/#overlay_tan"><b>Tan Le</b></a><b>, </b><b>CEO of </b><a href="http://emotiv.com/"><b>EMOTIV</b></a>, </strong>who spoke about how her company’s headsets are advancing the understanding of the human brain</p>

<p>TED has traveled to Tanzania, to Canada and to India. We’ve been to Germany, to Qatar and to assorted places throughout the United Kingdom and the state of California in the United States. But in a few weeks, we are headed for the first time to South America. <a href="http://conferences.ted.com/TEDGlobal2014/" target="_blank">TEDGlobal 2014</a> kicks off on Monday, October 6, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>So why Brazil? And why now? Curator Bruno Giussani explains.<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>“We wanted to go to South America because it’s one of the regions of the world where we’ve never had an official TED event, but where <a href="https://www.ted.com/about/programs-initiatives/tedx-program" target="_blank">TEDx</a> and the <a href="https://www.ted.com/about/programs-initiatives/ted-open-translation-project" target="_blank">Open Translation Project</a> and TED.com are really taking off in a significant way,” he says. “We went and visited several cities—not only in Brazil, but in other countries too. We looked at many different options—big cities, small cities, capital cities, far-off cities. In the end, Rio turned out to be not only a very attractive city, but also a vibrant hub of creativity and innovation. It’s a place where there is big thinking on the social and political issues affecting the world.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_91985" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-91985" src="http://tedconfblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/harsh-agarwal_daksh-baheti.jpg?w=900&#038;h=675" alt="Harsh Agrwal is the organizer of TEDxBhilwara, which he hopes proves that his city is more than a textile hub.

<p>Bhilwara is a city in Rajasthan, India, famous for its textile industry. Textiles dominate the local economy; after agriculture, it’s the leading employer in the city. The city is populated with spinning looms, fabric processing plants and weaving centers, producing huge swaths of yarn and thousands of tons of suiting fabric.</p>
<p>But seeing Bhilwara merely as a textiles hub prevents a real understanding of the city, says Harsh Agarwal, the 19-year-old who organized the first TEDx event here in July.</p>
<p>“Many do not know Bhilwara for its other special things,” Agarwal says, “like art and culture.” Too often, he says, his hometown is seen as stagnant and set in its ways, not a place where new ideas thrive. That’s why Agarwal decided to put together a TEDx event in Bhilwara centered on under-the-radar ideas, individuals and technology making waves in his hometown.</p>
<p>Agarwal learned about TED when his high-school teacher showed a few talks in class. Inspired by the breadth of ideas in the talks, Agarwal soon conspired to host a TEDx event at his high school with a friend. School and other activities won out, however, and his plans ended up on the back burner.</p>
<p>Flash forward to 2012, when a 17-year-old Agarwal received an invitation to attend<a href="http://www.ted.com/tedx/events/7215"> TEDxTheCalorxSchool</a> in Ahmedabad, a town near his own. He was touched by the experience. &#8220;Getting inspired from attending the TEDx event live, I felt honored and very special to be one among 100 attendees,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I then desperately wanted to know what goes on behind such a powerful event.&#8221;</p>
<p>After high school, Agarwal moved to Mumbai to attend university &#8212; and learn the ropes of TEDx event planning. As a student, he applied to work with local event<a href="http://www.ted.com/tedx/groups/1147"> TEDxGateway</a>; was accepted; and began to assist in speaker curation. &#8220;I learned a lot from [TEDxGateway organizer] Yashraj Akashi,&#8221; Agarwal said, &#8220;and he inspired me to pull off a TEDx event in my hometown for the community members who have no idea about what TED is.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_91986" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-91986" src="http://tedconfblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/audience.jpg?w=900&#038;h=595" alt="The smiling audience at TEDxBhilwara. Photo: Courtesy of TEDxBhilwara" width="900" height="595" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The smiling audience at TEDxBhilwara. Photo: Courtesy of TEDxBhilwara</p></div>
<p>Working with TEDxGateway gave Agarwal the confidence and practice he needed to take on a TEDx event in Bhilwara. To drum up interest in his hometown, Agarwal hosted two TEDx Salon events &#8212; events centered around watching and discussing recorded TED Talks. This led to a burst of excitement for his first live event.</p>
<p>&#8220;[I knew] the first event would not [necessarily] bring a big change but a small one &#8230; but after the event, I have observed that people started talking about TED, TEDx and its importance in the community, which they never did before,&#8221; Agarwal said. &#8220;Many of them started looking at collaboration in a different way and started reaching out to local speakers for collaboration on projects.”</p>
<p>Another interesting side effect: People piped up with their own ideas on who should speak. &#8220;After the event, many media people gave us names of amazing people who could be chosen to speak for the next edition of TEDxBhilwara,” he says. “Attendees of the event left the place with a complete different thought process because they saw and heard things they have never before.&#8221;</p>
<p>Agarwal also noticed changes in his own outlook after the event. &#8220;As the organizer, my experience has been full of excitement. I got to learn a lot about myself. In the course of planning and preparation, I did things I never did in my life before,” he says. “I saw the city through a different angle after the event. I get to see so much potential and passion in the people. I get to see an air of change blowing in the city, positive change.&#8221;</p>
<p>Overall, Agarwal says, he&#8217;s impressed &#8212; and extremely motivated &#8212; by the excitement and acceptance toward new ideas he&#8217;s seen in his community. &#8220;It was a sheer pleasure seeing the people in this small town coming together and showing so much interest and support in a TEDx event and its values and vision,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There is so much talent in this small city, and I found nothing better than a TEDx event to spread ideas and knowledge at a global level.&#8221;</p>
<p>Agarwal will be attending TEDGlobal 2014 as a TEDxChange scholar, and is hoping to draw some inspiration for the next TEDxBhilwara while in Rio. “I never thought in my wildest dreams when I first watched a TED Talk that I would ever attend a conference live,” he said, but in just a few weeks, he’ll join TEDx organizers from around the globe for a week of big ideas from speakers surfacing the intelligence and insights of their own cities, both small and large.</p>

<p><em>On September 24, TEDxCERN was hosted by physicist Brian Cox (watch his TED Talk: &#8220;<a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/brian_cox_on_cern_s_supercollider?language=en" target="_blank">CERN&#8217;s supercollider</a>&#8220;), and the world was welcomed to <a href="http://tedxcern.web.cern.ch/" target="_blank">watch for free</a>. <em>Below, an appetite-whetter that originally ran on the <a href="http://tedxinnovations.ted.com/" target="_blank">TEDx Innovations Blog</a>.</em></em></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong>Cosmic rays. Active galactic nuclei. Nucleosynthesis. For physicist Veronica Bindi, this is everyday vocabulary. A ten-year collaborator with <a href="http://ams.cern.ch/">AMS-02</a> — an experiment analyzing the data coming in from the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, a particle detector mounted on the International Space Station — Bindi deals with dark matter, solar activity, and the ins-and-outs of time of flight particle detectors with ease.</p>
<p>For someone without a double-digit career in particle physics, these topics can seem a bit intimidating. Bindi believes they shouldn’t be. Which is why when she was asked if she would contribute to a series of short physics-related lessons created by <a href="http://ed.ted.com/" target="_blank">TED-Ed </a>for <a href="http://tedxcern.web.cern.ch/" target="_blank">TEDxCERN</a>, she was both ecstatic and a bit daunted by the prospect. How would she make things like cosmic ray detection, collapsing stars, supernovae, black holes, and a years-long dissection of the building blocks of our universe come alive — in a video that clocks in at about four and a half minutes?</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-987 aligncenter" src="http://tedxinnovations.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/cosmic2.gif" alt="From Bindi's TED-Ed animation, &quot;How cosmic rays help us understand the universe&quot;" width="500" height="281" /></p>
<p>She was up for the challenge. She already knew about <a href="http://ed.ted.com/lessons">TED-Ed’s library of original animated lessons,</a> having used other CERN-written lessons to get high school students excited about STEM. (Her favorite is <a href="http://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-beginning-of-the-universe-for-beginners-tom-whyntie">“The beginning of the universe, for beginners”</a> by CERN physicist Tom Whyntie.)</p>
<p>“Sometimes I’d dream about what I would do if I could have the opportunity to develop my own animation,” she says. “So you can imagine my surprise when I received an email from the head of TEDxCERN, Claudia Marcelloni, asking if I was interested in making a proposal for an animation.”</p>
<p>Bindi’s proposal? A primer on cosmic rays — those intriguing particles from outer space that help scientists understand space itself. But after the excitement came the questions: How do you transform a complex scientific concept into an easily-digestible lesson? How do you make astroparticle physics palpable &#8230; and palatable?</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1016 aligncenter" src="http://tedxinnovations.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rocket.gif" alt="From Bindi's TED-Ed animation, &quot;How cosmic rays help us understand the universe&quot;" width="500" height="281" /></p>
<p>In tackling these questions, Bindi was not alone. She took on the script, while a team at TED-Ed — including lesson director and veteran animator <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtAJD7CkKvKqQqkgPevOxet9aBnG0EWBe">Jeremiah Dickey</a> — handled the animation. As a non-physicist, Dickey had his own challenges to face; mostly, translating the language of another field into that of his own. He had to transform science into art.</p>
<p>To figure out just how this happened, we spoke with both Bindi and Dickey via email. An edited version of the conversations follows:</p>
<p><strong>Veronica, what was it like working with an animator?</strong></p>
<p><strong>VB:</strong> This is my first animation, but I&#8217;ve thought many times about doing this. My field of specialization is astroparticles, and more than general physics, it is not easily understandable to people not involved with it. That’s a pity. I believe that animations are a key pathway to draw people’s interest to a new topic. Animations reach where words fail; they allow people to easily understand concepts that would be so complex to understand otherwise. I really liked working with an animation team. I appreciated the opportunity to see the many, tiny details they take care of. And all the steps — and the many different people involved — that lead to the final product.</p>
<p><strong>How involved were you in developing ideas for the animation?</strong></p>
<p><strong>VB:</strong> My task was the script, so I wrote the text. But the idea of making an animation was so fun that I ended up imagining and then proposing concepts. I really visualized it, frame after frame, in my mind.</p>
<p>When the TED-Ed team contacted me to show me the first draft of the actual animation, I was extremely excited, but also very scared at the same time. It was time to face the music. Of course, the animation was completely different from the one I had in mind: It was not so <em>Star Wars</em>, but it was much more fluid, more “universal,” and the message was really powerful and impactful. It was fascinating to see my story through the eyes of somebody else. It is amazing how everything changes when looking at it from different perspectives.</p>
<p><strong>Was it difficult to turn a scientific concept into a short lesson?</strong></p>
<p><strong>VB:</strong> I’ve done my best. I can assure you it was not an easy task. You need to summarize so many concepts. “Where to start? What to say? When to conclude?” All in just a few minutes. Your mind starts to spin around adding concepts, then deleting them, getting excited and then completely frustrated. “<em>Impossibile</em>!” I said to myself in Italian. “I can’t just summarize all that in a few concepts.” But then after a lot of re-wording and rewriting, the animation takes its shape, word after word, the script is complete. You really just love it.</p>
<p><strong>What was the most exciting part of the project for you? </strong></p>
<p><strong>VB:</strong> Just being part of it. The day before you just dream about making an animation, and the next day you are working with a team of professional animators. Is it not fantastic? I get goosebumps.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1014 aligncenter" src="http://tedxinnovations.ted.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/cosmic4.gif" alt="rom Bindi's TED-Ed animation, &quot;How cosmic rays help us understand the universe&quot;" width="500" height="281" /></p>
<p><strong>Jeremiah, how do you go about turning a complex scientific concept into an animation? Did you have a clear idea of what you wanted to do at the start, or do things morph as you go on?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JD:</strong> It’s rare that I have a completely clear idea at the start, but I do try to choose lessons to work on that spark some visual ideas at first. Invariably, the next step is then improving my own understanding of the subject, which is often fuzzy at best. I start by printing out the lesson with a lot of space between the lines so I can doodle on the page as I read it over and over. These doodles are usually worthless, but they’re a starting point — they make obvious the areas of the lesson I need to focus on. Research to bridge those gaps, lots of re-reading and more sketching eventually will lead to a cohesive plan that, hopefully, flows well and communicates the material in a compelling way. Figuring out how to visualize the material parallels my own path from ignorance to understanding it.</p>
<p><strong>From what did you draw inspiration while planning out the visuals?<br />
</strong><br />
<strong>JD:</strong> I’m really fond of mid-20th century “space age” art, a lot of which was really kind of propaganda for the Cold War space race between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R.  There’s a lot of great art that came out of that — on both sides — that is always a pleasure to delve into. I looked at the paintings of Robert McCall, who did a lot of fantastic concept art for NASA from the Apollo era onwards. There are also a couple of animated Disney films dealing with the science of space directed by Ward Kimball in the mid-1950s that always inspire. Not sure if I can say how any of these things directly influenced the animation, but they definitely informed it.<br />
<strong><br />
What was it like working with a scientist from CERN?<br />
</strong><br />
<strong>JD:</strong> It’s really an honor to get to work with people who are on the cutting edge of scientific discovery — and, to be honest, a little intimidating to be tasked with visualizing their lessons, as it’s likely how many are being introduced to the concepts they are studying at CERN. But Veronica’s lesson on cosmic rays does a great job presenting the material in a very clear way that really is the essence of good teaching — making the complicated understandable, and in this case, doing it in an appropriately mind-blowing context.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_91940" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-91940 size-full" src="http://tedconfblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/jewish-day-school-watchs-zak-ebrahims-talk-1.jpg?w=900" alt="Jewish-Day-School-watchs-Zak-Ebrahim's-talk-1"   /><p class="wp-caption-text">Students at the Davis Academy in Georgia contemplated the differences—and similarities—between Zak Ebrahim&#8217;s experience and their own.

<p>With Rosh Hashanah fast approaching, Sara Beth Berman of the <a href="http://www.davisacademy.org/" target="_blank">Davis Academy in Atlanta, Georgia</a>, wanted to create a lesson for the school’s middle school students around the ideas of empathy and forgiveness.</p>
<p>“In the month preceding the Jewish New Year, we talk a lot about how to forgive, how to accept forgiveness, and how do you want to be better in the new year,” says Berman, the experiential educator at this Jewish day school. “I was working on finding something to teach on these topics. And I was coming up short.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/zak_ebrahim_i_am_the_son_of_a_terrorist_here_s_how_i_chose_peace.html" class="video_teaser" target="_blank">
								<img src="http://images.ted.com/images/ted/a1035abfcdf56c2ce96afef6ccbdf678b936a1b1_240x180.jpg" alt="Zak Ebrahim: I am the son of a terrorist. Here&#039;s how I chose peace." width="132" height="99" />
								Zak Ebrahim: I am the son of a terrorist. Here's how I chose peace.
								<span class="play"></span>
							</a>But an a-ha moment came when one of her colleagues, Judaic studies teacher Samara Schwartz, forwarded her a TED Talk all about the life-altering things that happen when we dare to have empathy: <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/zak_ebrahim_i_am_the_son_of_a_terrorist_here_s_how_i_chose_peace/transcript?language=en" target="_blank">Zak Ebrahim’s “I am the son of a terrorist. Here’s how I chose peace</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>“I thought, ‘This is amazing,’” says Berman, who quickly jumped into a conversation with Schwartz, the school’s administrators and the school&#8217;s counseling team to discuss how to frame it for a lesson. “It&#8217;s this amazing person with such a positive message, who is a Muslim and whose father who was an extremist terrorist. I watched it a couple of times, and I knew it was going to be powerful.”</p>
<p>On Friday, September 12—just three days after Zak’s talk was released (and the day after September 11)—about 200 middle school students at the academy took part in a lesson framed around Zak’s talk and the song “Change Your Mind” by Sister Hazel. In the classroom where Berman observed, the students sat at desks arranged in a big U-shape and watched the talk. When Ebrahim revealed that his father is El-Sayyid Nosair, who was convicted of planning the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and who assassinated Rabbi Meir Kahane, the leader of the Jewish Defense League, in 1990, the kids audibly gasped.</p>
<p>“They couldn&#8217;t believe it,” said Berman. “They said, ‘We didn&#8217;t know that you could have a father that&#8217;s a bad man and then be so good.’ That&#8217;s really an important lesson for us in terms of teaching them how to make their own decisions and grow and be their own people.”</p>
<p>The students in the class also had a big reaction to the part of the talk where Ebrahim describes going to the shooting range with his father and uncles, and the glee that erupted when a target burst into flames. “I&#8217;m not sure how many of them could hear this,” says Berman, “but Zak said the Arabic phrase ‘ibn abuh’ &#8212; like father, like son. It sounds close to father in Hebrew—‘abba.’”</p>
<p>After watching the talk, the students got up from their seats. Around the classroom, a series of questions were posted for them to consider: How do you feel Zak’s experience growing up was different from yours? How was Zak’s childhood the same as yours? Why was he able to be empathetic? How could you be more open and welcoming to your peers who have struggled like Zak has?</p>
<p>Quietly, the students walked around and wrote down their thoughts on Post-it notes, which they then stuck to the walls. Says Berman, “Many students were like, ‘I ran out of Post-its. Can I have more Post-its?’”</p>
<div id="attachment_91937" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-91937 size-full" src="http://tedconfblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/jewish-day-school-watches-zak-ebrahims-talk-2.jpg?w=900" alt="Jewish-day-school-watches-Zak-Ebrahim's-talk-2"   /><p class="wp-caption-text">Students reflect on questions spurred by Zak Ebrahim&#8217;s TED Talk. Photo: Twitter/@sbbEZas123</p></div>
<p>Around the question, “Where do you learn stereotypes, and how can we bust them?” students posted answers like, &#8220;We learn stereotypes from the people around us, but we can bust them by doing what we think is right.&#8221;</p>
<p>The question, “Zak struggled as the new kid in class who was quiet and chubby. Have you ever felt like Zak?” also prompted some interesting answers. One female student wrote, “My brothers make fun of me for being small all the time. So I get what Zak is saying.”</p>
<p>Berman loved watching the students find common ground with Ebrahim. “There were some realizations that Zak was just like them—which was awesome. That&#8217;s all we want from our students: to realize that everybody is a human,” says Berman. “When you&#8217;re in middle school, it’s really hard to realize that there are other people around you that also have feelings. These are kids, so they aren&#8217;t on the terrorist path, but this reminded them that they also shouldn&#8217;t be on the bullying path. That they have choices.”</p>
<p>Overall, Berman calls the lesson “empathy paradise.”</p>
<p>The lesson also served as an important opportunity to talk to the kids about the realities of terrorism and about the importance of religious tolerance. “The majority of the kids were not born yet on September 11, 2001,” says Berman. “We really try to speak with kindness and to be authentic that we&#8217;re talking about a specific group of extremist terrorists—that we&#8217;re talking about ISIS, Hamas and Hezbollah, not Muslim people as a whole.”</p>
<p>Berman and her colleagues work hard to make sure that the students hear from people of many faiths. Last year, the school held a panel that brought together a rabbi, a Baptist preacher, a Presbyterian minister, and an imam, all senior clergy members from around Atlanta. Berman hopes that this talk will further help students be open-minded. “I enjoy finding things to help them have a nuanced understanding of Islam as a religion and Muslim people as a whole,” says Berman.</p>
<p>TED Talks are a popular teaching tool at the Davis Academy for students and teachers alike. And Berman hopes that this talk will have a lasting effect on how students think and act. “We want them to be able to have high-level conversations and to think about becoming a better person in the new year,” she says.</p>
<p>And for Zak Ebrahim, it was incredibly moving to see images of this lesson posted on Twitter. “Beautiful and humbling,” he wrote in response. “This is my dream.”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are" target="_blank">Power posing is always in style</a>. So we were excited to see it featured in <i>The New York Times</i> Fashion &amp; Style section this weekend in the article “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/fashion/amy-cuddy-takes-a-stand-TED-talk.html?_r=0" target="_blank">Amy Cuddy takes a stand</a>.” In a glowing article about the wide influence of her TED Talk (watch: <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are">Your body language shapes who you are</a>), the writer notes that it has affected “elementary school students, retirees, elite athletes, surgeons, politicians, victims of bullying and sexual assault, beleaguered refugees, people dealing with mental illness or physical limitations.”</p>
<p>This, we knew. (<a href="http://blog.ted.com/2012/10/01/10-examples-of-how-power-posing-can-work-to-boost-your-confidence/">See a collection of emails that Cuddy received in the months after her talk went viral</a>.) But what we didn’t know: “Power posing showed up twice in Dilbert comic strips, and Planters nuts and Secret deodorant have developed ad campaigns around it.”</p>
<p>Below, the evidence. First, Dilbert on power posing.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91925" src="http://tedconfblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/dilbert-177174-strip-zoom.gif?w=900&#038;h=279" alt="Dilbert 177174.strip.zoom" width="900" height="279" /></p>
<p>Amy Cuddy tweeted in response to this one, &#8220;Silly, Dilbert. THAT&#8217;s not the right way to power pose!&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91929" src="http://tedconfblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/dilbert-217167-strip-zoom-redo.gif?w=900&#038;h=279" alt="Dilbert 217167.strip.zoom redo" width="900" height="279" /></p>
<p>And speaking of comics, power posing also appeared in the comic Betty.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92018" src="http://tedconfblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/betty.jpg?w=900&#038;h=281" alt="Betty" width="900" height="281" /></p>
<p>Here, Mr. Peanut tries his hand at inspirational speaking, complete with his arms in the air.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='586' height='360' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/-dSy26nVm4E?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p>And the Secret ad that promotes power posing:</p>
<div class="embed-vimeo"><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/91525662" width="586" height="330" frameborder="0" title="Secret &quot;Fearless Power Pose&quot; :15" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p><span style="color:#ffffff;">.</span><br />
Power posing also got awesomely spoofed in this Vooza video.</p>

Earlier this summer, <a href="http://blog.ted.com/2014/08/05/how-a-ted-talk-helped-manish-dayal-in-the-hundred-foot-journey/" target="_blank">we spoke to actor Manish Dayal</a>, who used power posing to fuel his performance in the move <i>The Hundred-Foot Journey</i>. And <i>The New York Times </i>piece let us in on another actor using power posing as a form of method acting: Allison Williams of the show <em>Girls</em>. She tells the <em>Times</em> that she does the reverse of power posing. “Marnie generally has her shoulders forward, inched slightly up, and her arms folded as a line of defense,” she says.</p>
<p>Something none of the rest of us will ever do again, thanks to this talk that showed us how posture can make us feel about ourselves:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://tedconfblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/stemcellscecilia-large.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-91907 size-full" src="http://tedconfblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/stemcellscecilia-1.jpg?w=900&#038;h=623" alt="StemCellsCecilia-(1)" width="900" height="623" /></a></p>
<p>When Cecilia Matei’s science teacher showed a <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/susan_solomon_the_promise_of_research_with_stem_cells" target="_blank">TED Talk about the promise of stem cell research</a> to her class at the American School of Milan, Italy, she was immediately intrigued.</p>
<p>“For me it was a completely new subject that I had never heard of before,” the 13-year-old says.</p>
<p>The talk inspired her to create this drawing (click on it to see a larger version), a cross between a comic strip and a movie storyboard. While the star of the image is named “Jennifer Brain,” she closely resembles <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/susan_solomon_the_promise_of_research_with_stem_cells" target="_blank">real-life TED speaker Susan Solomon</a>, who at TEDGlobal 2012 shared the advances being made toward creating lab-grown stem cell lines, which could accelerate many types of medical research.</p>
<p>Matei’s teacher, Joseph Leonetti, handpicked this talk to kick off a special project for his students &#8212; as they did a three-week lesson on cell structures and processes in class, they were tasked with researching stem cells at home. “They were responsible for finding out what stem cells are, where they come from, how they are used and the ethical issues surrounding them. They were guided in the right direction,” he says. “Almost each class session started with students eagerly discussing what they had found out about stem cells the night before.”</p>
<p>This image was one of Matei’s homework assignments from the lesson. She walks us through the action of it: “Famous scientist Dr. Brain is invited to give a TED Talk about her studies,” she says. “She&#8217;s trying to convince people that stem cell research could help cure many diseases.”</p>
<p>In general, Matei says that her favorite subjects in school are math, English and, of course, science. “I loved every lab and experiment in Mr. Leonetti’s class,” she says. As for her favorite TED Talks she prefers ones “about new technological inventions.”</p>
<p>So we’ll have to wait and see what’s next for Dr. Jennifer Brain.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tedconfblog.wordpress.com/91906/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/tedconfblog.wordpress.com/91906/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.ted.com&#038;blog=14795620&#038;post=91906&#038;subd=tedconfblog&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Prosthetics as sculpture, the maternal benefits of breast milk, Cuba’s radical approach to free medical education. These are just a few of the subjects tackled at <a href="http://www.tedmed.com/" target="_blank">TEDMED 2014: Unlocking Imagination</a>, hosted last week simultaneously in San Francisco and Washington, DC, with a stage program directed by TED Fellow, physician, novelist and activist Nassim Assefi. On two stages over three days, 2,000 conference-goers and 80 speakers and performers gathered for an idea exchange on a vast range of subjects relevant to innovation in health and medicine.</p>
<p>A medical edition of the TED conference that was founded in 1995 (it&#8217;s now independently owned), we asked Assefi what made this TEDMED different from those in the past. “This was the most diverse TEDMED conference in its 19-year history,” she said. “We had slightly more women than men, more ethnic and international diversity than ever before, and a tremendous variety of fields. We didn’t point this out much during the program, but the impact of it did not go unnoticed.”</p>
<p>This year, it was truly a global event. “The conference was livestreamed to 146 countries free of charge, which felt like a democratizing coup,” Assefi added. “I believe being radically open is the wave of the future.”</p>
<p>In that spirit, for those of us not lucky enough to attend, the TED Blog hand-picked 11 of the most intriguing ideas presented on the TEDMED stage, and asked Assefi to tell us more about them. Find them below, grouped by theme. And for more speaker highlights, visit the <a href="http://blog.tedmed.com/" target="_blank">TEDMED blog</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_91833" style="width: 844px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-91833" src="http://tedconfblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-18-at-16-48-55.png?w=900" alt="Photographer Kitra Cahana turned her camera on her father, Rabbi Ronnie Cahana, to capture his experience with &quot;locked-in&quot; syndrome.

<h2><b>Reverberations in global health</b></h2>
<p><strong>1. Financial compensation for living kidney donors may be a reasonable way to handle the kidney shortage crisis</strong>. Iran is the only country in the world that has legalized the sale of kidneys from living donor volunteers. The government-endorsed program has been in existence for over 25 years and is implemented by non-profit health charities. Bioethicist <a href="http://www.tedmed.com/speakers/show?id=308934" target="_blank">Sigrid Fry-Revere</a> went on an underground research mission to investigate, and her counterintuitive research reveals that the Iranian solution may be the least exploitative, most equitable policy given the current kidney shortage crisis.</p>
<p><strong>2. Offering a free medical education could have big benefits for the world</strong>. Cuba-based American journalist <a href="http://www.tedmed.com/speakers/show?id=309041" target="_blank">Gail Reed</a> describes a radical experiment of solidarity undertaken by the Cuban government &#8212; founding the largest medical school in the world that freely provides training to students from the Global South, educating them to be humanitarian, holistic doctors. That experiment in radical generosity is now paying off: there’s a disproportionately high number of Cuban doctors currently volunteering in the Ebola crisis in West Africa, and these new graduates are quickly becoming a significant force in combating the global physician shortage in low-income countries.</p>
<div id="attachment_91834" style="width: 798px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-91834" src="http://tedconfblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-18-at-16-43-35.png?w=900" alt="Bob Carey started talking self-portraits of himself in a pink tutu for his wife when she was diagnosed with breast cancer.

<h2><b>Art therapy</b></h2>
<p><strong>3. Creativity can come from something as difficult as &#8220;locked-in&#8221; syndrome.</strong> Photographer and TED Fellow <a href="http://www.tedmed.com/speakers/show?id=292956" target="_blank">Kitra Cahana</a> is well known for documenting marginalized communities. (Watch her TED Talk, “<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/kitra_cahana_stories_of_the_homeless_and_hidden?language=en" target="_blank">A glimpse of life on the road</a>.”) But when her beloved father, a rabbi, suffered a stroke resulting in “locked-in” syndrome &#8212; he could move only eyelids but had full cognitive functioning &#8212; she turned her camera inward to document his experience. Instead of pitying himself for his near total paralysis, Rabbi Cahana finds spiritual liberation and blinks out long, transcendent sermons to Kitra and her family, who steadfastly watch over him. The result of their three-year journey is a new visual art form that’s both eerie and beautiful, matching her father’s extraordinary spiritual resilience.</p>
<p><strong>4. A photograph can be grown.</strong> <a href="http://www.tedmed.com/speakers/show?id=309793" target="_blank">Zachary Copfer</a> was a microbiologist working for a pharmaceutical company who fell out of love with his profession and escaped to art school instead. In the process, he invented <a href="http://www.sciencetothepowerofart.com/" target="_blank">bacteriographs</a>, a new photographic process where he literally grows photographs in living bacteria &#8212; and, paradoxically, reignited his passion for science.</p>
<p><strong>5. A pink tutu can be a tool in cancer treatment.</strong> Another photographer, <a href="http://www.tedmed.com/speakers/show?id=309750" target="_blank">Bob Carey</a>, turned to self-portraits as a form of self-soothing when his wife Linda was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer. His favorite prop was a pink tutu, which cheered him from the bleakness of Linda’s diagnosis and made her laugh. When she shared his images with her fellow chemotherapy patients and saw the comfort they offered, <a href="http://thetutuproject.com/" target="_blank">The Tutu Project </a>was born. Today, Bob continues to do ballerina self portraits all over the world, donating a portion of profits to help cancer patients cope with health care expenses. The hilarious and beautiful photos remind us that sometimes, laughter heals best.</p>

<h2><b>Nature’s genius</b></h2>
<p><strong>6. While only 7% of US hospitals promote breast-feeding, it has big health effects for mothers.</strong> It’s well known that breastfeeding is beneficial to babies, but the research of internist and University of California, Davis, Professor <a href="http://www.tedmed.com/speakers/show?id=309868" target="_blank">Eleanor “Bimla” Schwarz</a> reveals that breastfeeding matters to the health of mothers at <i>least</i> as much. It makes all kinds of sense &#8212; humans are mammals evolved to nurse their young, and lactation facilitates post-pregnancy recovery. But the medical world has ignored the maternal effects of breastfeeding. Schwarz takes an evidence-based perspective, concluding that women who don’t breastfeed are more likely to end up obese, with diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and heart disease. The tragedy? Only 7% of US hospitals adequately promote post-partum breastfeeding.</p>
<p><strong>7. Evolutionary biologists and veterinarians can contribute to human healthcare.</strong> UCLA cardiologist <a href="http://www.tedmed.com/speakers/show?id=292974" target="_blank">Barbara Natterson-Horowitz</a> was the echocardiography doctor on call when the Los Angeles Zoo phoned requesting help with a chimpanzee who’d suffered a stroke. That call made her realize that she’d never once considered the reverse kind of consultation, and she soon adopted a species-spanning view to the practice of medicine. These days, she integrates an evolutionary medicine approach to medical care, with such initiatives as the  “Darwin on Rounds” program, in which evolutionary biologists accompany internal medicine physicians on rounds, and the <a href="http://zoobiquity.com/" target="_blank">Zoobiquity</a> conference, which brings together physicians and veterinarians to solve common problems. The questions that drive her approach: 1) What do animal doctors know about this problem that I don’t know? 2) Could I do a better job if I started looking at my human patient as a human-animal?</p>
<div id="attachment_91857" style="width: 993px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-91857 size-full" src="http://tedconfblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/bacteriograph-of-barbara-natterson-horowitz.jpg?w=900" alt="This is a bacteriograph, created of speaker Barbara Natterson-Horowitz by microbial artist Zachary Copfer. The bacteria used? E Coli. Photo: Zachary Copfer"   /><p class="wp-caption-text">This is a bacteriograph, created of speaker Barbara Natterson-Horowitz by microbial artist Zachary Copfer. The bacteria used? Staphylococcus aureus. Photo: Zachary Copfer</p></div>
<h2><b>Paradigm shifts</b></h2>
<p><strong>8. Placebos have real effects.</strong> Harvard researcher <a href="http://www.tedmed.com/speakers/show?id=309804" target="_blank">Ted Kaptchuk</a> originally studied Chinese medicine, but quickly became fascinated by the placebo effect &#8212; that elaborate ritual of words, symbols and transmitted hope that surrounds medical care. His <a href="http://tedkaptchuk.com/bibliography" target="_blank">groundbreaking research </a>shows that placebos may actually be the most critical ingredient in healing. In studies that are anathema to medical convention, Kaptchuk demonstrates that placebos exhibit the same, quantifiable neurobiological effects of “real” pharmaceutical drugs and interventions.</p>
<p><strong>9. Prosthetics don&#8217;t have to look like natural limbs &#8212; they can be works of art.</strong> <a href="http://www.tedmed.com/speakers/show?id=293049" target="_blank">Sophie de Oliveira Barata</a> was crafting prosthetic limbs for amputee patients when it occurred to her that not all patients may want an exact replica of their lost extremity. Since then, she’s been sculpting custom-made, surreal, flamboyant limbs that express the individual personalities of her patients &#8212; including accessories such as crystals, jewels, lights, drawers, and speakers. These alternative limbs are their own kind of art form, inviting curiosity and conversation.</p>
<h2><b>Modern-day medical sermons</b></h2>
<p><strong>10. Doctors can cause diseases, if they don&#8217;t listen carefully.</strong> Actor and playwright <a href="http://www.tedmed.com/speakers/show?id=292983" target="_blank">Elizabeth Kenny</a> was a healthy 32-year-old woman who went to the doctor for a common gynecologic ailment. A year and a half later, she was in a locked level 5 psychiatric ward. Her two-year odyssey inside the United States’ healthcare system inspired her to write and perform a one-woman show, <i>Sick,</i> that challenges health providers to listen carefully to their patients before reflexively prescribing drugs that may actually cause <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iatrogenesis" target="_blank">iatrogenic illnesses</a>.</p>
<p><strong>11. The identity of &#8220;cancer survivor&#8221; isn&#8217;t for everyone.</strong> For writer, ordained minister, and hospital chaplain <a href="http://www.tedmed.com/speakers/show?id=293022" target="_blank">Debra Jarvis</a>, humor is a powerful balm. She’s not afraid to be funny even when doing very serious work with the sick and dying, or relaying her own story of living through breast cancer. Jarvis challenges the long-term spiritual impact of self-identifying as a cancer survivor, despite all the forces pushing her to do so. Her conclusion: “Claim your experience. Don’t let it claim you.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91882" src="http://tedconfblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/favorite_apps.png?w=900&#038;h=650" alt="Favorite_apps" width="900" height="650" />At our small, fast-moving nonprofit company, everyone does a couple of jobs &#8212; and productivity apps help us manage roles that shift between coding, writing/designing and running a full-scale conference twice a year. We asked the TED staff what apps they can’t live without. And beyond the classics—<a href="http://instagram.com/">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.maps&amp;hl=en">Google Maps</a>, <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://www.uber.com/">Uber</a>, <a href="http://www.seamless.com/">Seamless</a>—we found some great apps that might help you too. (A star denotes that the app is free, or at least has a free version.)</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<h2>For random life stuff&#8230;</h2>
<p><b><a href="http://darkskyapp.com/" target="_blank">Dark Sky<br />
</a></b>A weather app with startling accuracy, its interface tells you things like: “Light rain starting in 22 minutes.” It also shows you beautiful weather maps that let you play local-news weather expert. “It’s like a wizard,” says our CTO, Gavin Hall. “If this app were available in the 1600s, it would have been burned at the stake for witchcraft.”</p>
<p><b>*</b><b><a href="https://calendar.sunrise.am/" target="_blank">Sunrise<br />
</a></b>Like your Google Calendar with key improvements, several staffers swear by this app. It offers shortcuts for adding events, and also bakes things like weather reports and Facebook birthday reminders into the mix of your daily calendar.  “It’s awesome,” says IT Manager Francil Richards.</p>
<p>*<b><a href="https://www.key.me/" target="_blank">KeyMe<br />
</a></b>Communications manager Samantha Kelly was excited to download this app, as she recently got locked out of her apartment. She says, “You scan your keys by taking a photo of them and then you have ‘digital copies.’” With the copy, you can get a key made for you at a KeyMe kiosk (they currently have five in New York) or through the mail. Fingerprint scan is required.</p>
<p>*<b><a href="http://www.thinkdirtyapp.com/" target="_blank">Think Dirty<br />
</a></b>This app tells you exactly what’s in the personal care product you’re about to buy. You scan the barcode, and it shares information about potentially harmful ingredients (and gives alternatives, if you want them). It’s useful for fact-checking label claims like “all-natural” and “organic.” Kyle Shearer of our Events Workgroup says, “It helps me make informed choices on products that I am bringing home.”</p>
<p><b><a href="http://yogastudioapp.com/" target="_blank">Yoga Studio<br />
</a></b>Yoga Studio reminds us of the <a href="http://www.ted.com/surpriseme">“Surprise Me” feature</a> on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ted/id376183339?mt=8" target="_blank">TED app</a>. You pick the kind of yoga class you want (strength, flexibility, relaxation), your level (beginner, intermediate or advanced) and the amount of time you have (20 minutes, 40 minutes or longer) and it creates a class for you. “Whenever I am traveling or too busy to exercise, I sneak in a lesson,” says Product Development Manager Jai Punjabi.</p>
<p>*<b><a href="https://getpocket.com/" target="_blank">Pocket<br />
</a></b>One of those apps on this list that you may already know about, it lets you save blog posts and articles to read when you’re offline. TEDx Digital Strategist Alex Rudloff says, “I&#8217;m able to keep track of all the articles that get sent my way. In this post-Google Reader world, it&#8217;s my primary way of keeping up on things.” Community Support Manager Mireille Pilloud adds, “They send out a weekly email I like that shows the most-Pocketed articles and suggests articles for me based on what I generally read.” Another feature that gets big ups from our staff—the fact that you can set the font size because it strips out the content’s original formatting.</p>
<p>*<b><a href="http://vsco.co/vscocam" target="_blank">VSCO Cam<br />
</a></b>It doesn’t have a name that rolls of the tongue, but this app is great for helping turn ho-hum snapshots into arty photographs. Janet Lee of our Distribution team says, “A year ago, I was scanning my Instagram feed and noticed a lot of ‘moodier’ photos. The beauty of this app is that it doesn’t matter how bad your framing is, you can just wash it out. It’s maximum likes on instagram, with low effort.”</p>
<p><b><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/camera360-ultimate/id443354861?mt=8" target="_blank">*Camera360<br />
</a></b>This app has more than 200 photo filters and 10 modes. But the real benefit, says Executive Producer of TED Media June Cohen, is that images are for your eyes only. “I like Camera360 for creating Instagram-like photos I don&#8217;t want to share publicly,” she says.</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<h2>For staying organized&#8230;</h2>
<p>*<b><a href="https://www.wunderlist.com/" target="_blank">Wunderlist<br />
</a></b>An app that lets you create shareable lists of favorites—be they restaurants, sites in a city, or movies. But it’s better known for its shareable to-do lists. “It organizes my life,” says Anjali Mohan of our Client Services Workgroup. “I use it at work and at home. My husband gets reminders from the app when he needs to clean.&#8221; Production Manager Kristel Ottis also swears by this app. “There&#8217;s simply no other way I could keep track of all the nitty-gritty details that go into each production,” she says.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://www.dayonedesign.com/memail/" target="_blank">MeMail<br />
</a></b>This app does one thing really well—you can send yourself an email in two taps, for quick reminders or ideas you don’t want to forget. “It’s helped me get rid of all the fiddly bits of paper in my pocket,” says Product Development Associate Bedirhan Cinar.</p>
<p>*<b><a href="https://trello.com" target="_blank">Trello<br />
</a></b>A slightly more visual rendering of your to-dos, this app allows you to create boards for different projects and separate sharable lists within them. Each task goes on a separate card. “I&#8217;ve tried tons of task apps, and Trello is by far my favorite,” says Social Media Editor Nadia Goodman. “I love how easy it is to customize, color code, and rearrange things. It&#8217;s also really easy to make collaborative boards and store information &#8212; like files, notes or images &#8212; within a task. My one complaint is that I wish it would ping me when a due date is coming up!”</p>
<p>*<b><a href="http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/" target="_blank">nvALT<br />
</a></b>A spin-off of Notational Velocity, this app is popular with techy types because it includes MultiMarkdown functionality. Front-End Developer Joe Bartlett explains, “I&#8217;m naturally scatterbrained and love nvALT for storing and indexing the sorts of details I used to jot down haphazardly and forget: conference notes, obscure math and command line tricks, what cartridge the printer takes,” he says. “It adds extra customization options.”</p>
<p>*<b><a href="https://en.todoist.com/" target="_blank">Todoist<br />
</a></b>Like both Wunderlist and Trello, this to-do list helper has both an app and a web client that communicate. “I found this in my never-ending search for the perfect task management app,” says Product Development Associate Will True. “This isn’t necessarily it, but it provides simple task organization—by project, category, priority, due date. It&#8217;s not fancy, which is honestly why I like it. It also has great APIs so I can hook other things or build my own little tools on the data it provides.”</p>
<p>*<b><a href="https://check.me/" target="_blank">Check<br />
</a></b>This app keeps track of all your bills and when they are due, and also monitors your bank and credit card accounts. Most importantly, it tells you when there’s a mismatch between the two &#8212; i.e. when you’re about to get charged an overdraft fee &#8212; so you can fix the problem. “It’s way better than Mint,” says IT Manager Francil Richards. “It means I’m never late on payments.”</p>
<p>*<b><a href="https://evernote.com/" target="_blank">Evernote<br />
</a></b>Evernote is an organizational tool that you can use as a storing place for short notes, or as a place to collect all your thoughts—links, photos, notes, checklists—for larger projects. “Evernote is awesome because it’s versatile,” says Junior Designer Lilian Chen. “You can use it for storing receipts and outlining travel plans and meeting notes.”</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<h2>For getting around&#8230;</h2>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/city-maps-2go-pro-offline/id327783342?mt=8" target="_blank"><b>CityMaps2Go</b><b> Pro<br />
</b></a>This app downloads offline, zoomable, searchable maps of major cities, so that even if you are roaming around Tokyo and can&#8217;t read any of the signs, you can still find your way around. “It’s good for people like me who travel internationally, but don&#8217;t like to get data plans,” says Thu-Huong Ha, of our editorial team.</p>
<p>*<b><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/word-lens/id383463868?mt=8" target="_blank">Word Lens<br />
</a></b>Another great app for travelers, Word Lens visually translates printed text into your language in real time. When you snap a photo of a sign or document, it shows the image to you in English. “It’s crazy,” says Kyle Shearer of our Events Workgroup. “The translations are not always 100%, but it’s good enough to get by on.” Hello, food menus.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.moves-app.com/" target="_blank">*<b>Moves<br />
</b></a>Moves tracks every step you take, which sounds creepy, but is actually useful. “It quantifies how many miles you&#8217;ve walked, cycled and run,” says Patrick D’Arcy, of the TED Fellows team. “It&#8217;s not about the calories burned for me, but the ability visualize where I&#8217;ve gone on a map. A friend actually introduced me to the app when he came back from Mexico City and he was able to show me the exact routes he took.”</p>
<p>*<b><a href="https://www.waze.com/" target="_blank">Waze<br />
</a></b>An app to help you get stuck in traffic as infrequently as possible. Drivers share real-time traffic delays—accidents, traffic jams, and the like—so that you can avoid them. The head of our Media Team, June Cohen, once mentioned this app a staff meeting, and lots of us are using it now.</p>
<p>*<b><a href="http://www.roadify.com/" target="_blank">Roadify<br />
</a></b>This app gives you real-time data on transit info in 50 cities in the US and Canada. “I know when the next bus or train is coming and, if it&#8217;s not there, the reason for the delay,” says Anna Verghese, Deputy Director of the TED Prize. “Psychologically, I like knowing when I reach the subway station that the train is four minutes away, so that I don&#8217;t have to hurl myself down the subway stairs.”</p>
<p><b><a href="http://www.exitstrategynyc.com/" target="_blank">Exit Strategy<br />
</a></b>This app is for New Yorkers only. (Sorry.) It helps you plan your subway route, down to where to stand on the platform, and which exit to use to get to your destination in the quickest amount of time. “It speaks to my need for efficiency,” says producer Roxanne Lash.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://letsembark.com/" target="_blank">Embark<br />
</a></b>Other staffers also recommend Embark, which is a route-planning app akin to Hop Stop that integrates information about delays. It’s available in 10 cities and has a big bonus: it works underground, without connection.</p>
<p>*<b><a href="http://www.c25k.com/" target="_blank">Couch to 5k<br />
</a></b>“This app trains you to run a 5k. It gives you audio alerts when to start running/walking,” says Accountant Erline Maruhom. “The idea is that you should be able to run a 5k in nine weeks. We&#8217;ll see &#8230; I’m hopeful.”</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<h2>For computer and email ease&#8230;</h2>
<p><b><a href="http://www.boomeranggmail.com/" target="_blank">*Boomerang<br />
</a></b>This is app for Gmail that is majorly handy. It lets you set a notification to pop up if you haven’t gotten a reply on an email within a specified amount of time. It also lets you boomerang messages back to the top of your inbox, closer to when you actually need to pay attention. But the feature our staff members love: you can schedule emails to send later. “I tend to write emails in bulk at night or on the weekend—but don’t want to bug anyone then,” says writer Kate Torgovnick May. “It’s nice to be able to schedule an email for a more appropriate time and hit send.”</p>
<p>*<b><a href="http://www.mailboxapp.com/" target="_blank">Mailbox<br />
</a></b>This app helps you archive and trash email—or put off emails you don’t have to respond to immediately until a later date—with a left or right swipe. It also shows whole conversations with a cool interface that looks a lot like a chat. “On the train into work, I can quickly sift through all the emails and start my day with a clearer head,” says Post Production Manager Gwen Schroeder.</p>
<p>*<a href="https://www.authy.com/" target="_blank"><b>Authy</b> </a><b><br />
</b>This app disconnects 2-step authentication from text messaging, and does it in a way that’s a little more secure, should your phone fall into the wrong hands. “This is especially handy for when I’m in areas with no reception or am international and don’t have a texting plan,” says Product Development Associate Bedirhan Cinar. “Google offers an identical app, but I like Authy better because you can password protect it so if someone has your phone, they can’t easily access your 2 step codes.”</p>
<p>*<b><a href="http://qsapp.com/" target="_blank">Quicksilver<br />
</a></b>“It lets you search, find and open applications and files on your Mac quickly using shortcut keys,” says TEDx Branding Coordinator Boian Filev. “It has really sped up finding and opening files that might be buried deep in folders.”</p>
<p>*<b><a href="https://justgetflux.com/">Flux<br />
</a></b>This app rocks for anyone who has eyes that are sensitive to the bright light of a computer screen. It makes your computer or iOS device display adjust to the time of the day, and get warmer and dimmer at night. “It keeps me from getting a headache in the evening,” says writer Kate Torgovnick May. “I also appreciate it at TED Conferences, when we can sometimes end up being in a dark theater all day. It’s nice to get some demarcation of what time it is outside.”</p>
<p>But enough about us. What&#8217;s the app that YOU find most helpful on a day-to-day basis?

<p>From healthy food projects to public health campaigns, TED@Unilever highlighted ideas to inspire leaders at every level. At this <a href="https://www.ted.com/about/programs-initiatives/ted-institute" target="_blank">TED Institute event</a>, which showcased speakers from both inside and outside the wellness company, the focus was on what corporations and individuals can do to initiate change.</p>
<p>Below, some words from each of the TED@Unilever talks:<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">“In most companies, the sustainability group is separate from the marketing team, which is separate from the communications team. Why? If we’re going to make sustainable living commonplace, we need to engage scale &#8230; When someone asks, &#8216;What is the case for sustainability?’ I ask, ‘Well, what is the case for the alternative?&#8217;” —<b>Keith Weed, </b><a href="http://www.unilever.com/" target="_blank"><b>Unilever</b></a><b> Chief Marketing and Communications Officer</b></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">“The greatest innovations happen when solving the most basic problems. At Next Drop, our vision is to create a world where everyone has access to basic resources like water &#8212; thanks to a live, human-powered smart grid. All it takes is a mobile phone.” —<b>Anu Sridharan, </b><a href="http://nextdrop.org/" target="_blank"><b>Next Drop</b></a><b> cofounder</b></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">“Around the world, diarrhea is the second largest killer of children under 5. We thought this was a hardware issue — that the solution was about getting people toilets. We were wrong. It’s about public health education.”  —<b>John Kluge Jr., </b><a href="http://toilethackers.org/" target="_blank"><b>Toilet Hackers</b></a><b> cofounder</b></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">“What’s the world’s best invention in public health? Soap. Handwashing can save lives. And brands have a responsibility to do good in the places where they are sold.” —<b>Myriam Sidibe, Global Social Mission Director for </b><a href="http://www.lifebuoy.com/" target="_blank"><b>Lifebuoy</b></a><b> soap</b><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">“When we take the time to see the world as kids do, one thing stands out: a child’s overwhelming desire to learn. How do we help kids learn to take control of their lives to create bright futures?” —<b>Richard Neville, </b><a href="http://www.animl.co.uk/" target="_blank"><b>Animl.co.uk</b></a><b> founder and filmmaker</b></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><b>“</b>Unilever factories are challenged to create zero waste to landfill. The Waraqa Centre is one project that’s helping them do that &#8212; by training community members in ways to re-craft packaging byproducts into new, salable products.” —<b>Rania Bahaa, Environmental Specialist at Unilever Mashreq in Egypt</b></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><b>“</b>Structural change and climate change are two transformations we face over the next few decades that will determine whether we face the best of centuries or the worst of centuries. Fortunately, good decisions can bring quick results. If we do the first one well [the structural change], then the second one [climate change] will become much easier.” —<b>Lord Nicholas Stern, author of the </b><a href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/earth-and-environmental-science/climatology-and-climate-change/economics-climate-change-stern-review" target="_blank"><b>Stern Review on </b><b><i>The Economics of Climate Change</i></b> </a><b>and former Chief Economist of Climate Change</b><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">“Talking about body image improvement isn’t enough on its own. We also have to act and educate for body confidence. The best programs out there address six core themes: family, friends and relationships; teasing and bullying; talking about appearance; media and celebrity culture; competing and comparing looks; and respecting and looking after ourselves. Improving girls&#8217; body image requires all of us to be role models.” —<b>Meaghan Ramsey, global director of the </b><a href="http://selfesteem.dove.us/" target="_blank"><b>Dove Self-Esteem Project</b></a><b> at Unilever in London</b></p>
<div id="attachment_91866" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-91866" src="http://tedconfblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/tedunilever_rl_0468_983px.jpg?w=900&#038;h=599" alt="Anu Sridharan inspired at TED@Unilever.

<p style="padding-left:30px;"><b>“</b>We need to tackle our largest challenges first. On way to start tackling sustainability is by asking, ‘What’s your heresy? How will you challenge how you live and do business?’” —<b>Andrew Winston, strategist and author of </b><b><i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Big-Pivot-Radically-Strategies/dp/142216781X" target="_blank">The Big Pivot</a></i></b></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">“While creating <b><a href="http://h2haiti.org/" target="_blank">H2H, Help to Haiti</a></b>, I learned many lessons, including these: 1) When you start doing something good, you meet good people along the way. 2) Shut up and listen. What are the priorities of the people you’re trying to help?” —<b>Viviana Alvarez, Unilever Global Foundation Ambassador and co-founder of </b><b><a href="http://h2haiti.org/" target="_blank">H2H, Help to Haiti</a></b><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">“My grandfather’s grandfather and his young bride came to Iowa with all their worldly possessions. Today, computers are as much a part of the modern farm as horses were to my grandfather’s. Innovation continues to happen on farms, every day.” —<b>Mark Jackson, CEO of Jackson Farms LS, Inc.</b></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">“Cooking isn’t just about food &#8212; it’s about memory and connection. We have to find the path back to the kitchen. We need to go back to the basics and grow some of what we eat. Let’s reclaim the kitchen.” —<b>Einav Gefen, lead Corporate Chef at Unilever’s North America kitchens</b><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><b>“</b>How will we solve the food challenge going forward? No one company can do it. It really is about the food system working together. Together, man can and must prevent famine in the future.” —<b>Jack Sinclair, executive vice president of the </b><a href="http://www.walmart.com/" target="_blank"><b>Walmart</b></a><b> US Grocery Division</b><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><b>“</b>Do you know where your next meal is coming from? Me too. Imagine if you didn’t. Now know that 46 million people in the U.S. are living in poverty today.

<p style="padding-left:30px;">“I wish the bakery could help everybody. They empower people every day. I still have friends in the streets selling drugs.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ted.com/participate/ted-fellows-program/apply-to-be-a-ted-fellow"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-91825 size-full" src="http://tedconfblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/fellows-apply.jpg?w=900&#038;h=900" alt="Fellows-apply" width="900" height="900" /></a></p>
<p>Dear [Your Name Here],</p>
<p>At the <a href="http://www.ted.com/participate/ted-fellows-program" target="_blank">TED Fellows program</a>, we look for extraordinary young innovators, inventors and leaders—like you—from many categories of human endeavor: scientists of all sorts, engineers, artists, filmmakers, photojournalists, entrepreneurs, NGO founders, technologists, inventors, human rights activists and more. Our goal is simple: to help you accelerate your career.</p>
<p>Concerned about whether you have a chance of becoming a TED Fellow? Learn more about the program below. But first, read the fears and concerns that some of our most successful TED Fellows felt before they filled out that <a href="http://www.ted.com/participate/ted-fellows-program/apply-to-be-a-ted-fellow" target="_blank">fateful online application</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><i>“I didn&#8217;t think I was good enough. I applied on a whim because I didn&#8217;t think there was anything to lose. I still have apprehensions about whether I am good enough or not.” </i><b><i>—<a href="http://blog.ted.com/2012/07/13/the-call-of-the-whale-fellows-friday-with-asha-de-vos/" target="_blank">Asha de Vos</a>, TED Senior Fellow, marine biologist and blue whale expert, Sri Lanka</i></b></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><i>“When I first applied, I didn&#8217;t know whether I was truly qualified. But I figured I would let the staff decide, and not write myself out of the conversation before a word had been exchanged.” </i><b><i>—<a href="http://blog.ted.com/2014/01/17/celebrating-the-cultural-in-between-fellows-friday-with-musician-meklit-hadero/" target="_blank">Meklit Hadero</a>, TED Senior Fellow, singer/songwriter/producer, U.S./Ethiopia</i></b></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><i>“I didn’t know if my projects were relevant to a program like this, or if my profile was a good fit.” </i><b><i>—Camilo Rodriguez-Beltran, artist/scientist/entrepreneur, Argentina/Spain</i></b><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><i>“Was I gonna make it with so many other super-qualified people applying?”</i><b><i> —<a href="http://blog.ted.com/2012/05/11/life-on-mars-fellows-friday-with-angelo-vermeulen/" target="_blank">Angelo Vermeulen</a>, NASA mission commander/artist/engineer/scientist, Belgium</i></b></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><i>“I was worried I wouldn&#8217;t fit in.” </i><b><i>—<a href="http://blog.ted.com/2014/04/25/eman-mohammed/" target="_blank">Eman Mohammed</a>, peace activist and tour operator, Palestine/Israel</i></b></p>
<p>You’ve got until September 24 at midnight <a href="http://www.ted.com/participate/ted-fellows-program/apply-to-be-a-ted-fellow" target="_blank">to apply for a TED Fellowship</a> for the <a href="http://conferences.ted.com/TED2015/" target="_blank">TED2015 conference</a> in Vancouver in March. So apply! Really, you have nothing you lose. Except that many of you don’t, year after year, even though you want to. Instead of worrying about whether you’re qualified, imagine instead: that after careful consideration—including an interview and vetting process—you are selected out of the thousands who apply.</p>
<p>What are the benefits of being a TED Fellow? We offer unique experiences and services that help you grow your career while maintaining work/life balance. We prepare you to deliver your own TED Talk at the conference, taking you through the intensive presentation process. We give you world-class coaching, mentoring and public relations services, as well as an immersive pre-conference before TED itself. You become a part of the TED community, and get plugged into the dynamic Fellows network of nearly 350 extraordinary thinkers from about 90 countries. A private online venue lets you connect brain-to-brain on any topic, and this community has a well-deserved reputation of helping you in ways both quick and profound.<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>You can come from anywhere in the world. (We especially love applicants from the global South, from Africa, Asia, Latin America as well as Russia, China and the Middle East. But really, anywhere.) You are just as likely to be a woman as a man. You are 21-45 old, most likely—though as long as you are 18, you can apply.</p>
<p>It takes a few hours to fill out the application. So why not do it? Some of our successful Fellows have told us that they almost didn’t apply because they were intimidated. You might be thinking, &#8220;I don’t have a chance; I’m not good enough; I’m not qualified; I’ll be more ready next year, especially after I have completed X (my degree, a project, etc); I’ll never get in; I already got declined once*.” If any of the above have occurred to you, we want to encourage you to go for it. Perhaps these words from a current TED Fellow will help:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><i>“It’s an intimidating program to apply for because the number of applicants is so high. It takes a certain level of confidence and audacity. In a good way.” </i><b><i>—Katie Hill, clean energy activist, U.S.</i></b></p>
<p>If you are an innovator, if you’ve done something novel or significant, if you’ve made a documentary about an unjust situation, if your camera has documented the consequences of a war, if you are obsessed with studying one species, if you are making art from novel materials, if you’re starting a cool new company, if your NGO is serving people ignored by the world, if you’re a geneticist trying to foil an invasive species, if you are a stand up comedian whose work is deeply political, if you are a physicist studying the Big Bang, if you are an astronomer trying to discover new planets outside the solar system, if you are amazing in YOUR field of endeavor, we want to learn about you. <a href="http://www.ted.com/participate/ted-fellows-program/apply-to-be-a-ted-fellow" target="_blank">Go ahead and apply</a>. Your chances are much better than you think.</p>
<p>Looking forward to reading your application,</p>
<p>Tom Rielly<br />
TED Fellows Director</p>
<p>PS: <a href="http://www.ted.com/participate/ted-fellows-program/apply-to-be-a-ted-fellow" target="_blank">Apply here</a>. Or <a href="http://www.ted.com/participate/ted-fellows-program" target="_blank">learn more about the Fellows</a>. And take a few minutes to <a href="http://www.ted.com/participate/ted-fellows-program/meet-the-ted-fellows" target="_blank">meet our existing Fellows</a>.</p>
<p>*Reapply if you wish! Many Fellows have been selected after applying several times.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91817" src="http://tedconfblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/sylvia-earle-with-jellyfish-feature.jpg?w=900&#038;h=1047" alt="sylvia-earle-with-jellyfish-feature" width="900" height="1047" /></p>
<p>How colorful is the ocean floor? And what exactly do you <i>do</i> when you run out of air underwater? Yesterday, we invited all of you to talk with oceanographer Sylvia Earle about her adventures as a deep sea diver. Earle is <a href="http://www.ted.com/participate/ted-prize/prize-winning-wishes/mission-blue-sylvia-earle" target="_blank">a TED Prize winner</a> and the subject of a <a href="http://blog.ted.com/2014/08/15/mission-blue-chronicles-ocean-champion-sylvia-earle/" target="_blank">new documentary, <i>Mission Blue</i></a>, which gives an inside look at her lifelong mission to save our oceans.</p>
<p>Below, we collected some of the best moments from this Facebook Q&amp;A. (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/TED/posts/10154570648630652" target="_blank">You can read the full Q&amp;A here</a>.)</p>
<p><b>Q: What is a thought or feeling you have only when diving?</b></p>
<p>A: One of the special things about diving is that you are suspended by the water, so you can do extraordinary things you can’t do on land. You can essentially fly. There&#8217;s nothing quite like that!</p>
<p><b>Q: What has been your most memorable interaction with a whale?</b></p>
<p>A: My first glimpse of whales on their own terms was on February 14, 1977, offshore from Maui. Five whales came directly for the little boat I was in with three other people. We looked over the side and they were looking up at us. No one at that time had been diving with whales. It was so exciting to have these giants come rushing towards me, looking at me with those great eyes and then circling around and coming back for another look. They seemed as curious about us as we were about them. It gave new meaning to the term “whale watching.”</p>
<p><b>Q: How crisp are the colors on the ocean floor? Is it really like in the movies?</b></p>
<p>A: In the deep sea, it&#8217;s dark! Below 1000 feet, it’s dark all the time, except for the light that many of the animals and bacteria actually generate: <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/edith_widder_the_weird_and_wonderful_world_of_bioluminescence?language=en">bioluminescence</a>, the kind of light that fireflies and glowworms make.</p>
<p><b>Q: What kind of technology (other than the obvious SCUBA suits and such) do you use to help you explore?</b></p>
<p>A: I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of using more than 30 different kinds of submarines—little subs. Some of them are simple enough to drive that even I as a scientist can be the pilot.</p>
<p><b>Q: How do you feel about what is going on with Sea World?</b></p>
<p>A: I think the only marine mammals that should be in captivity now in the 21st century are those animals that have been rescued, rehabilitated and cannot go back to the wild. Or those that have been born in captivity and couldn&#8217;t readily survive in the wild. There is no reason anymore to take marine mammals from the wild. We didn’t know 50 years ago what the consequences were, but now we know how devastating this is to the social structure of these animals.</p>
<p><b>Q: What do you do when you run out of air?</b></p>
<p>A: I&#8217;ve had some close encounters with running out of air. I was actually living underwater, so I couldn&#8217;t go back to the surface directly. But I was diving with a buddy and we shared air to get back to home base.</p>
<p><b>Q: What is the scariest experience you&#8217;ve had during a dive?</b></p>
<p>A: The scariest experience with my diving comes on the highway getting to the ocean. That&#8217;s always the case &#8230; that&#8217;s really scary!</p>
<p><b>Q: On behalf of my kids who would love to ask you, what ocean animal do you find most fascinating, and why?</b></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>My answer might surprise you: humans. Like all creatures who actually live in the ocean, we too are sea creatures. We need the ocean as much as the dolphins, whales, coral reefs and sea stars do. No ocean, no us. The ocean touches us with every breath we take, every drop we drink. And now the ocean really needs us to take care of the problems that are affecting its health.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tedconfblog.wordpress.com/91813/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/tedconfblog.wordpress.com/91813/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.ted.com&#038;blog=14795620&#038;post=91813&#038;subd=tedconfblog&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91807" src="http://tedconfblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/tedlive-blog.jpg?w=900&#038;h=600" alt="TEDLive-Blog" width="900" height="600" /></p>
<p>Just in time for <a href="http://www.ted.com/attend/conferences/tedglobal" target="_blank">TEDGlobal</a> next month, we’ve rebuilt our <a href="http://tedlive.ted.com/" target="_blank">TED Live</a> program, allowing you to watch the entire conference—or a single day of it—on a high-definition live stream anywhere in the world, anytime. 7 reasons to try it:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>You’ll gain insight into what’s going on in the world</b>. The <a href="http://blog.ted.com/2014/09/02/tedglobal-2014-the-full-lineup-revealed/" target="_blank">TEDGlobal 2014 program</a> is designed to look at the forces underlying recent news stories &#8212; and at the larger phenomenon shaping our global landscape. As you watch TED Live, you’ll see these big themes emerge, session by session. And you might even see a little breaking news.<br />
<span style="color:#ffffff;">.</span></li>
<li><b>It’s cost efficient</b>. Watching all four days of the TEDGlobal conference on TED Live costs $500, and we’ve also added a day pass option, for $200. TED Live is a great way to support TED’s nonprofit mission of spreading ideas &#8212;  and get a concentrated dose of inspiration in return.<br />
<span style="color:#ffffff;">.</span></li>
<li><b>You’ll see every talk first. </b>Talks from TEDGlobal will be released free to the world over the upcoming year. Just like always, we release one TED Talk per day, every weekday. TED Live allows you to see all the talks right as they happen.<br />
<span style="color:#ffffff;">.</span></li>
<li><b>You can watch TEDGlobal whenever you like</b>. With TED Live, you can choose to watch the sessions as they happen, or you can time-shift into your own time zone (or to a more convenient day altogether), using our online archive feature. It’s the TED Conference on your time.<br />
<span style="color:#ffffff;">.</span></li>
<li><b>You can make it a social occasion</b>. TED Conference sessions spark great conversations. Invite some friends or family members to watch a session with you over brunch &#8212; or host a dinner party you’ll never forget. Your TED Live membership allows you to display the feed to up to 10 friends. (If you’d like to throw a larger viewing party, <a href="mailto:live@ted.com" target="_blank">write us</a>.)<br />
<span style="color:#ffffff;">.</span></li>
<li><b>Your feedback matters</b>. With TED Live, you’ll be able to rate each speaker during the conference and let us know which ideas resonate the most with you. Your ratings will help us decide which talks end up on our homepage first as free TED Talks.<br />
<span style="color:#ffffff;">. </span></li>
<li><b>It makes a cool gift</b>. Certain people in your live have no need for more stuff. Why not give them a TED Live subscription? If you’re interested in doing this, email live@ted.com with the names of recipients and their contact info, and we’ll contact you to complete your transaction. From there, you’ll just need to figure out how to put a bow on it.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Bonus. </b>As a TED Live member you’ll join community groups, schools and universities throughout Rio de Janeiro who are watching the event for free. TEDGlobal Para Todos will bring a free conference livestream to groups all over the city, in return for Rio’s kind hospitality to TED.

<p><strong>By Kate Torgovnick May and Krystian Aparta</strong></p>
<p>Music is the universal language. So why, then, do so many songs get translated? Sometimes, bands adapt their lyrics into English to reach international audiences—which explains why so few of us can sing ABBA in the band members’ native Swedish. Other times, songs are adapted into local languages for international release, as exemplified by this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC83NA5tAGE" target="_blank">25-language compilation of “Let It Go”</a> from Disney’s <i>Frozen</i>.</p>
<p>Lyrics translators are faced with a painful trade-off: do you go for accuracy or strive to make the translation singable? <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/daffodil_hudson_is_this_the_cure_for_stage_fright.html" class="video_teaser" target="_blank">
								<img src="http://images.ted.com/images/ted/cfa8ec527e9bb37dca7d5513ab829f25c246b52d_240x180.jpg" alt="TED staff: It&#039;s TED, the Musical" width="132" height="99" />
								TED staff: It's TED, the Musical
								<span class="play"></span>
							</a>But our <a href="https://www.ted.com/participate/translate" target="_blank">Open Translation Project</a> volunteers working on the parody video “<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/daffodil_hudson_is_this_the_cure_for_stage_fright" target="_blank">TED, the musical</a>” found themselves dealing with an even bigger challenge: How do you translate comedy lyrics and, on top of that, make them work as printed subtitles?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ted.com/profiles/361170/translator" target="_blank">Khalid Marbou</a>, who translates TED Talks into Arabic, initially hesitated on whether to take on this translation at all. “I figured that no matter how good I made it, it still would feel weird to read something in a completely different rhyme than what you are listening to. It felt like an impossible task,” he says. But in the end, he was glad he accepted the challenge. “I tried my best, and it certainly was a lot of fun. It turned translation into more of a creative process.”</p>
<p>Translator <a href="https://www.ted.com/profiles/2256889/translator" target="_blank">Stanislav Korotygin</a> also emphasized the creative joy of bringing this madcap talk into Russian, but admits that translating lyrics is alway a difficult balancing act. “It&#8217;s like searching for the best path through the forest which must satisfy several conflicting criteria: it must be the shortest, the nicest <i>and</i> the safest. And you have to meet the wolf on the way,” he jokes. “You start thinking like a poet or songwriter.”</p>
<p>But what works in one language may not be possible in others. To Japanese translator <a href="https://www.ted.com/profiles/543950/translator" target="_blank">Kazunori Akashi</a>, the main goal was making the subtitles short enough to enable viewers to easily follow the video, while also following Japanese lyrical traditions. “I tried to adopt the conventional Japanese style of lyrics, namely using phrases which consist of five or seven syllables,” he explains. “For example, when I translated the line ‘It’s your time to shine,’ I did ‘Kimi-ga-kagayaku / toki-ga-kita,’ which are seven and five-syllable phrases.” And to <a href="https://www.ted.com/profiles/1703609/translator" target="_blank">Mile Živković</a>, the number of syllables proved to be the biggest challenge in the Serbian translation. “It required me to compress everything so that I could imagine singing it in Serbian,” he says. “Initially, I attempted to make the entire song rhyme, but it proved virtually impossible with the line length.”</p>
<p>“<a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/daffodil_hudson_is_this_the_cure_for_stage_fright" target="_blank">TED, the Musical</a>” has now been translated into 30+ languages, and counting. <a href="http://www.ted.com/profiles/78265/translator" target="_blank">Krystian Aparta</a>, TED’s Localization Community Manager who’s worked with many Polish bands on translating their songs, is in awe of the OTP volunteers’ results on this talk. “There’s so much work that goes into translating lyrics: you need to think about the connotations of the words, rhymes, alliteration, which words will be stressed by the singer, how to adapt the song to make as much sense in the target culture… By translating these lyrics and bringing the fun and humor in this video to so many audiences all over the world, these guys are truly proving that music can be the universal language.”</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tedconfblog.wordpress.com/91783/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/tedconfblog.wordpress.com/91783/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.ted.com&#038;blog=14795620&#038;post=91783&#038;subd=tedconfblog&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><strong>By Baratunde Thurston</strong></p>
<p>So, you might know me. I ran the digital side of <i>The Onion </i>for a long time; I’m the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062003224/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0062003224&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=teco06-20&amp;linkId=5ENCMYLTPPQRYNC6" target="_blank"><i>How To Be Black</i></a>. People call me to do things like host White House events on innovation, do the wrap-up at TED salons, join <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/people/directors-fellows" target="_blank">semi-secret cabals at MIT</a>, and comment on the teevee. The underlying constant in my multi-hyphenate life is running my creative company, Cultivated Wit. I’m proud of what we do, but part of the deal with an agency-client relationship is: you keep it quiet.</p>
<p>But I’m working on a campaign right now that I’m so proud of, I&#8217;m speaking up loudly. Because this topic hits close to home.</p>
<p>Today, Cultivated Wit launches a co-funded digital campaign to inspire math, science, tech and engineering (or STEM) undergraduates and recent grads to teach. Through teaching, they can change how young people see themselves and affect the world around them, while helping the U.S. finally surpass the Slovak Republic in <a href="http://www.ccesc.org/education-2/u-s-results-are-in-for-the-2012-pisa/" target="_blank">our mathematics ranking</a>.</p>
<p>Simply put: <a href="http://blowminds.org" target="_blank">Blow Minds. Teach STEM</a>.</p>
<p>Leading the effort to answer President Obama’s 2011 call for 100,000 new STEM teachers by 2021 is the organization <a href="http://100kin10.org" target="_blank">100Kin10</a>. This network of 200 organizations (corporations, universities, non-profits, school districts, federal agencies, museums, states and others) has combined forces to co-fund this campaign and bring Voltron-like collaborative power to this important mission.</p>
<p>True to our origins in humor (several other founders worked for <i>The Onion, </i>too) and design (our newest partners added an actual art degree to our wall), Cultivated Wit has built a campaign that’s fun, smart, and hopefully as awesome as the teachers who, every day, expand kids’ minds in classrooms, labs and computer rooms across the country.</p>
<p>This animated music video acts as the anthem of our message.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='586' height='360' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/WxVO_5RGM4A?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span></p>
<p>I rarely get as personally involved in our client work as with this project, but this topic hits close to home. I’m the product of an investment in STEM education myself.</p>
<p>Before my 12th birthday, I met several of the Tuskegee Airmen, thanks to one of my <a href="http://www.bancroftelementary.org/" target="_blank">Bancroft Elementary School</a> teachers who set up an “Air and Space Club” at our DC public school.</p>
<p>As a teenager, I got a computer to do my bidding &#8212; my bird beat up my friend’s bird &#8212; thanks to programming in C on the broadband-connected UNIX terminal at the Sidwell Friends upper school circa 1994.</p>
<p>Pre-dating all that, I came home to an internet-connected computer because my mind-blowingly awesome mother knew and lived the power of STEM to transform possibilities for our family. She had taught herself enough to trade in her employment as a domestic and clerical worker for a career as a COBOL programmer for the federal government, making her effectively a pre-founding member of <a href="http://www.blackgirlscode.com/" target="_blank">Black Girls Code</a>.</p>
<p>All this had a clear impact on the trajectory of my life. These are just some of the titles I’ve held: telecom analyst, political blogger, director of digital for <i>The Onion</i>, director’s fellow at the MIT Media Lab, CEO/hashtagger-in-chief of Cultivated Wit, club bouncer (this last one required lots of counting!).</p>
<p>The TED community is one I don’t have to preach to much about the power of science, technology, engineering, math and education in general to change the world. I could point to <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/kevin_slavin_how_algorithms_shape_our_world" target="_blank">Kevin Slavin’s talk</a> about algorithms dominating our financial markets or <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/adam_spencer_why_i_fell_in_love_with_monster_prime_numbers">Adam Spencer’s exuberance</a> for hunting “monster prime numbers” or <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/richard_turere_a_peace_treaty_with_the_lions" target="_blank">Richard Turere’s anti-lion defense system</a>. And then there’s infectiously positive <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/rita_pierson_every_kid_needs_a_champion" target="_blank">educator Rita Pearson</a> and <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/christopher_emdin_teach_teachers_how_to_create_magic" target="_blank">science advocate Christopher Emdin</a> on “creating magic” in the classroom.</p>
<p>On top of that, you’ve got <a href="http://ed.ted.com/" target="_blank">TED-Ed</a> (a 100Kin10 partner, by the way) and the <a href="http://www.ted.com/participate/ted-prize/prize-winning-wishes/school-in-the-cloud-sugata-mitra" target="_blank">TED Prize for the School in the Cloud</a>, both of which promote expanded access to education. And I’d like to think I contributed peripherally to the pro-mind-blowing TED camp with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydIumAMjjwg" target="_blank">my recent TEDxKC talk</a> about the value of integrating humor into our techno-fabulous future.</p>
<p>Many of these talks are possible because the speakers had teachers who took the time to transfer not just their knowledge but their attention, empathy and belief in us.</p>
<p>So, how can you get involved? Start with spreading the word. Do you know people who work in the sciences, technology or engineering fields? Do you know people who use math? Are you connected to teachers or students or student-teachers? Do you know people who sometimes think about tomorrow? Then they are invested in the future.</p>
<p>Please share this campaign with them because, generally speaking, minds don’t blow themselves. Much of our future (and the amazing TED talks they will produce) depends on getting more excellent STEM teachers in the classroom today.</p>

<p>Writer/director <a href="http://stewartthorndike.wordpress.com/bio/" target="_blank">Stewart Thorndike</a> is working on a trio of female-driven horror films &#8212; sharp, low-budget psychological thrillers. Her first installment, <i>Lyle</i>, stars Gaby Hoffman as a mother trying to protect her toddler from sinister forces. Thorndike is now running a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1966172888/putney-director-of-lyles-new-film-about-a-haunted" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign to fund the second film, <i>Putney</i></a>, which is billed as being about “a haunted TED Talk.” We wanted to know: what does that even mean?!? So we called her for a chat.</p>
<p><b>Can you tell me a little bit about </b><b><i>Putney</i></b><b>?</b></p>
<p><i>Putney</i> tells the story of four women who go to the country to bond. The main character is inspired to do the whole trip because of a TED Talk, which is a hybrid of someone like <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability" target="_blank">Brené Brown’s, on vulnerability</a>, and my own imagination. It gives her an idea to reconnect with her girlfriend of four years and their estranged best friend. They all go to this hotel where they used to go, the Putney — and an uninvited guest comes along and sort of ruins the dynamics. All these things go wrong, so the main character keeps retreating to go watch this TED Talk for advice. And the talk starts to give her stranger and stranger advice.</p>
<p><b>Do you watch a lot of TED Talks?</b></p>
<p>I am a big TED lover, but I don&#8217;t watch as many as many people I know. I think what interests me about messing around with one is that a lot of the horror I make is about taking contemporary, safe things and fooling around with them so they become scary. I didn&#8217;t start the story with the TED Talk craziness in mind. But when I started to think about the things that you might turn to for counsel and support, I thought of moms, and friends, and therapists, and TED Talks. A TED Talk is stamped with intellectual and pop-culture legitimacy. So it&#8217;s funny for me—and perverted and interesting—to mess around with that.</p>
<p><b>This is your second female-driven horror film. Why is having a female-driven narrative important to you?</b></p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;m a female writer and director, and I don&#8217;t write many stories with guys in them. So I have never even questioned it — I just make movies with women, because they&#8217;re the people who interest me. When you start looking at it, it&#8217;s like, man, we need them. We need so many more stories with women.</p>
<p><b>Why are you drawn to horror?</b></p>
<p>I was always drawn to the dark stuff, ever since I was a little kid, and I think women need horror just as much as men do. I think people need to test their philosophies and belief systems in the most exaggerated ways. Plus, I always argue that horror is the most sensual of all the genres. People are in a heightened state, everything&#8217;s a little altered, and you don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s real or what isn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s visually exciting for me to play with horror.</p>
<p><b>That’s really interesting. I am a very easily frightened person, and I tend to shy away from horror films.</b></p>
<p>I hear that sometimes. I&#8217;m really curious if women don&#8217;t like horror because men have taken over the brand and made a certain kind of movie that we just don&#8217;t want to watch — horror that&#8217;s geared towards 18-year-old boys. I think that the type of horror that is out there right now is about sadism, and a bad guy, and it&#8217;s very simple and thin. It&#8217;s a very clear sensation of: &#8220;I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m not the character in this movie, running away from the chainsaw.&#8221; It&#8217;s a weird pornographic kind of sensation. You&#8217;re not thinking about anything. Sadism is simple; there is nothing there.</p>
<p><b>Right. When I think of watching horror, I feel disgust and fear. It’ll just be these unpleasant feelings, and I will want them to end.</b></p>
<p>But if you felt disgust and fear over what it&#8217;s like to take care of your dying father, and all those complications, it might be more interesting.</p>
<p><b>Very possibly. So how is the Kickstarter campaign going?</b></p>
<p>It’s awesome that Kickstarter exists. Films like this haven’t gotten made, and you wonder if it&#8217;s because there isn&#8217;t an audience, or because the machine that has been in charge of making movies has just decided there isn&#8217;t an audience. So being able to control how you&#8217;re going to show your movie, and find your fans and have them support your next movie—it’s really empowering. We&#8217;re down to the last days of our Kickstarter, and it&#8217;s exciting and cool that we have a way to get funding for a film without the usual, traditional models.</p>
<p><b>Will you find a way to make the film if you don&#8217;t make the Kickstarter goal?</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m used to hustling, so we&#8217;ll certainly try.</p>

<p>With his tethered quadcopter <a href="http://www.fotokite.com/" target="_blank">Fotokite</a>, Russian-born inventor Sergei Lupashin plans to put aerial photography and the power of unmanned aerial vehicles in the hands of of journalists, architects and artists. Interestingly, this device was actually inspired by a 2011 protest in Russia. We talked to Lupashin to find out more about this inciting moment, and about how he plans to push past the public’s fear of drones.</p>
<p><b>You&#8217;ve said that the idea for Fotokite came from witnessing a protest. Can you tell us more about that?</b></p>
<p>The protest I was referring to took place in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolotnaya_Square">Bolotnaya Square</a>, in 2011, in response to massive irregularities in federal elections. Something very rare happened &#8212; a lot of people came out to protest in Moscow. For Russia, this was a huge event. But for whatever reason, the world media pretty much ignored it.</p>
<p>There happened to be a group of photographers nearby who usually do nature shots. They take quadcopters and octocopters to, say, the Sphinx or the Pyramids, and take these fantastic panoramas. They happened to be just around the corner, so they did a few panoramas of the protest. In a single image, you really got an the idea of the scale of this event. It was really eye-opening. Ironically, these photographers were completely apolitical. They were simply documenting what was going on near them. It struck me how powerful it is &#8212; how even a single photo from an aerial perspective can really change the world’s perception of situations and events.</p>
<p>This is still a motivator for us, and we’d like people to take the Fotokite to breaking news events. TED Senior Fellow Teru Kuwayama once said to me that you only need a very small shift in perspective to be able to make a great, unique photo. This is also quite interesting to me, because the Fotokite really opens up your envelope in terms of where you can place the camera.</p>
<p><b>You first came to TED as part of the team manning the </b><a href="http://www.flyingmachinearena.org/"><b>Flying Machine Arena</b></a><b> at TEDGlobal 2013.</b><b><i> (</i>Watch the talk, &#8220;<a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/raffaello_d_andrea_the_astounding_athletic_power_of_quadcopters" target="_blank">The astounding athletic power of quadcopters</a>.<i>&#8220;) </i></b><b>What’s the difference between the quadcopters you demonstrated there and the technology you use for Fotokite? </b></p>
<p>The quadcopters we showed at TEDGlobal were part a larger system. The Flying Machine Arena is essentially a motion-capture space configured for robotics, surrounded by a net cage. Motion capture is usually used in Hollywood to track actors, but in this case, we used it to track vehicles. The quadcopters are only able to fly so precisely because they&#8217;re being tracked by external cameras, in real time, with extraordinary accuracy. It’s a very expensive—a very specialized system that you couldn&#8217;t actually use in the real world beyond performances and installations.</p>
<p>So the question was: how do we build something for the real world, something really simple that you could use outside of a very controlled setup? The Flying Machine Arena served as an incredible sandbox for exploring various directions and concepts with the technology. We learned to build the Fotokite in this environment.</p>
<p>Every photographer knows how to use a tripod. So the idea emerged to build a tripod that could extend very high up, say, 100 meters. Initially, we were using different algorithms to make this “flying tripod” work, but ultimately, a tether proved to be a very elegant solution. The tether is always taut, so we can use it for two things. One is to interact with the vehicle &#8212; you can control it like a flying pet. The other is to let the vehicle know where it is, relative to the user. This replaces expensive cameras and GPS.</p>
<div id="attachment_91742" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-91742" src="http://tedconfblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/mr_001.jpg?w=900&#038;h=600" alt="Lightweight and small, the Fotokite can be launched and ready for action in a  minute. Photo: Milan Rohrer/Fotokite" width="900" height="600" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Lightweight and small, the Fotokite can be launched and ready for action in a minute. Photo: Milan Rohrer/Fotokite</p></div>
<p><b>How does it work? Is there a camera that reads where the tether is?</b></p>
<p>That&#8217;s the magic of it: there are no special sensors. It&#8217;s using the same sensors you have in your phone, for example. The magic happens is in the algorithms. So we&#8217;re using inertial sensors, very simple sensors that have been made affordable and incredibly reliable thanks to smartphones and consumer electronics, to measure accelerations and rates of rotation. Then we apply estimation algorithms to figure out the angle of the vehicle relative to the user.</p>
<p><b>So the sensors figure out the angle of the quadcopter to the person using the algorithms, with the tether as a reference point?</b></p>
<p>Exactly. There&#8217;s always a tether, and because it&#8217;s always kept taut, it&#8217;s always stretched, it&#8217;s always producing a force pulling on the quadcopter. We can observe this force using these sensors, and therefore, if we know what that force is, we can figure out where the quadcopter is relative to the person. This means we can also stabilize and do intelligent things based on that data.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s something really cool there as well. The quadcopter is aware of the user, of the person pulling on the leash. So we can actually use it as a communication channel. So you can do things like walk around with the leash, and the quadcopter moves with you. But you building on top of that, you can actually communicate with tugs and things such, so you can give it commands by physically pulling on the tether and it can even give you feedback by tugging back. It&#8217;s as if it&#8217;s a flying dog.</p>
<p><b>How high can it go, so far?</b></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve gotten up to 150 meters, which is when we ran out of string. We actually use dog leashes, for convenience.</p>
<p>I think that the main idea is to not go very high, because you want to be close enough to what you&#8217;re filming to actually capture detail. What&#8217;s been interesting so far is the 0 to 30 meter range. You can imagine if you&#8217;re a journalist or an architect or archaeologist, you always have a particular scene that you&#8217;re filming. When you want that, you need perspective.</p>
<p>In our latest version, we also offer a special leash that feeds power up to the Fotokite from the ground, which lets you fly as long as you can provide electricity from a backpack battery &#8212; from your car, from the grid, and so on.</p>

<p><em>Above: See what the Fotokite can capture from above in this demo video by Andy Armstrong on Vimeo.</em></p>
<p><b>What kind of camera is on there?</b></p>
<p>Right now we usually use a GoPro camera. It&#8217;s very lightweight, which means the whole thing is safer and more comfortable to use. We support other, heavier cameras as well, but the payload could be really anything &#8212; an air-quality sensor, a radiation sensor, and so on. It’s a platform for carrying anything, which is really neat. For example, we&#8217;re doing a research project where we&#8217;re trying to find baby deer using infrared cameras. We have this payload bay, and you can 3D print any sort of holder for your instrument on your printer. It&#8217;s pretty straightforward.</p>
<p><b>Can you talk about the ethics of drones? People are concerned &#8212; how are you addressing that?</b></p>
<p>With drones, there&#8217;s a lot of concern around privacy. People are afraid that someone can use this thing to observe them &#8212; whether it&#8217;s the government, or other people taking pictures of them in their garden, on the beach, wherever. At the same time, there&#8217;s a clear benefit to having this perspective. For example, any time you’d normally need to climb up high just to look at something &#8212; like to take a photo of your property, or inspect the roof &#8212; you could use one of these remote cameras. So there&#8217;s a conflict in terms of how allowing one set of people to pursue this unique perspective easily infringes and intrudes on the privacy and comfort of others.</p>
<p>This is actually a pretty old problem. Aerial photography can be traced back to at least 1906. There’s a beautiful photo of San Francisco after the great earthquake taken by George Lawrence using kites &#8212; a beautiful, huge, high-quality photograph. If you look at the legal history as well, it goes back decades.</p>
<p>With the Fotokite, the difference is that there is a physical link to the operator. This means that  anyone can observe who is responsible at any point. Hence, a lot of these ambiguities get eliminated. You always know who is operating the vehicle, and you always know if you&#8217;re safe or not. In other words, is the machine physically capable of reaching you?</p>
<p><b>Do you think Fotokites will need to be licensed?</b></p>
<p>What we&#8217;re seeing is in a lot of countries, you do have to have a license to operate a drone with a camera, for commercial use. In the US, actually, they tried to ban drones &#8212; any sort of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) &#8212; for commercial use it altogether. I think they made one exception, which is a large airplane, just now. However the FAA in the US (and some other authorities around the globe) typically exclude tethered vehicles from regulations and/or certification.</p>
<p><b>But how is that different from, say, Google going around with a van and photographing every single street window?</b></p>
<p>With a normal, untethred UAV, you have no idea who&#8217;s operating it. So it is quite different. With a car, you can always say there&#8217;s a driver who’s ultimately responsible. With a UAV hovering 100 meters away, you don&#8217;t know. It could be anyone within a kilometer.</p>
<p>In the US, I think the main concern is not actually privacy, but airspace regulations &#8212; making sure that these things don&#8217;t fly into airports or into other airplanes. But for example in Switzerland, for Google Street View, they had to lower the height of the cameras to around two meters, because they were considered too intrusive. Ironically enough, in Switzerland, you can actually fly a drone as long as it&#8217;s line-of-sight, and you have insurance, things like that. In the US, as long as you’re doing commercial work, you can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Right now, the world is in this very funny transition phase where all of the rules are very different from place to place, and they&#8217;re changing very quickly. We have to consider all of this as we develop.</p>

<p><b>Where are you in development now? </b></p>
<p>We&#8217;re doing some early trials with first customers, especially journalists, and learning a lot from that. We’re always improving the robustness and practicality of the device. The latest version works with your phone for live preview and control, for instance. There&#8217;s a lot of footwork that goes between having the proof of concept &#8212; what I demoed at TED &#8212; and actually having even a minimal, basic product.</p>
<p><b>Have you had a lot of interest in Fotokite since TED?</b></p>
<p>Yes. TED was really great in terms of helping us define the vision and the mission of the company. It&#8217;s really motivating day-to-day for everyone in the office to know that we&#8217;re doing this for a decent reason. And working with other TED Fellows has been really cool. For example, we’re sending Fotokites out with TED Fellow <a href="http://blog.ted.com/2014/05/02/explorer-steve-boyes-takes-us-on-an-epic-journey/" target="_blank">Steve Boyes</a> to the Okavango Delta in South Africa, to help him document the expedition. This delta is one of the richest wildlife areas on the planet and Boyes is currently out with a team of scientists, artists and engineers, collecting data in the area and, essent taking its pulse w.</p>
<p>The BBC also used a Fotokite unit to film part of a show. This was a real learning experience, because they weren&#8217;t interested in any of the fancy features that we were talking about. For them, they are in the field, it&#8217;s rainy, and there&#8217;s a group of five people filming badgers or something. They&#8217;re filming from 6am to midnight &#8212; they&#8217;re tired. It&#8217;s terrible weather, everyone&#8217;s grumpy. So they loved the idea that it&#8217;s reliable and super easy to use. And that it&#8217;s compact.</p>
<p><b>Are you interested in photography, or art? What was your path here?</b></p>
<p>I spent a lot of time in academia on various robotics projects. I worked on an autonomous car for the DARPA Urban Challenge. I came to Switzerland to work on robotics from an academic perspective, basically building cool toys. And I think that Fotokite reflects a bit of my feeling that I was getting quite isolated from having a real impact on the world. It&#8217;s cool when you make a really nice YouTube video where a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sUeGC-8dyk">quadcopter plays a piano</a>, and it&#8217;s fun &#8212; but I wanted to make something that would be really useful in normal life.</p>
<p>At the same time, I saw a lot of people building flying cameras from hobbyist components. This is kind of also leading to a weird transition market where you really have these really large things flying in the air, and they&#8217;re actually quite dangerous. I mean, sometimes it&#8217;s done professionally, but sometimes it&#8217;s also just cobbled together. So if we can build something a bit more elegant that does the same job, it would be a nice contribution.</p>

<p><b>Where are you customers? Who are they?</b></p>
<p>Our customers are really all over the world. This is really cool, because we get to talk to a lot of different people, who have very different concerns, and very different motivations for wanting Fotokite. And because we&#8217;re actually building the solution, we have a hand in the conversation as well. We&#8217;re not passively providing something; we are trying to encourage uses of the technology that we think are responsible. For example, journalism and news gathering is a particularly interesting application looking for a practical solution &#8212; drones are used a bit today, but they come with a swarm of complications like certification, pilot training, safety concerns, accountability and privacy issues.</p>
<p><b>But you can&#8217;t control who will buy your product, can you?</b></p>
<p>In the end, of course not. But we can certainly control what kind of projects we do, where we put our focus. For example, we&#8217;re working on making cameras stable and usable for newsgathering by providing appropriate live-streaming technology packaged in the unit. We could just as easily be working on an infrared camera that has 100x zoom, that can follow someone &#8212; clearly a much more suspicious project. We choose to pursue only what we believe can be shown to have clearly legitimate, public-interest uses.</p>
<p><b>What&#8217;s the ultimate vision? Will Fotokite be on shelves at a department store? </b></p>
<p>We are considering direct sales, also a Kickstarter campaign. We’re trying to keep the perspective that what we’re building should be a modular platform: so a consumer Fotokite should hackable and compatible with off-the-shelf, open-source autopilot. So people could add their own modifications and think of new crazy use cases, like flying umbrellas. Or if you have an idea that you want to make a lamp out of this thing, or a Burning Man art installation, you can do that without reverse-engineering everything.</p>
<p><b>Were you expecting to be an entrepreneur?</b></p>
<p>Not really. But I also didn&#8217;t expect to earn a PhD, so I guess things develop with opportunities. It&#8217;s been a wonderful experience. At the end of the day, it&#8217;s about learning new things, and also trying to make a difference. That&#8217;s the whole thing. Starting a company &#8212; and building a product that empowers people like journalists in what they do best &#8212; is a really great way to do it.</p>

<p>On the anniversary of September 11, we&#8217;re proud to launch an idea that is the deepest possible antidote to terror. It&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.ted.com/read/ted-books/the-terrorist-s-son" target="_blank">powerful story of Zak Ebrahim</a>, who grew up the son of a terrorist (his father helped plan the 1993 WTC bombing), and chose tolerance over hatred.</p>
<p>This idea reaches you in a form that&#8217;s new for us: It&#8217;s the first in a series of book-talk pairings that allow us to go deeper on our mission. The 9-minute talk astounded the audience at TED2014, bringing them to their feet. The book picks up where Zak&#8217;s talk left off, delving deeper into <a href="http://www.ted.com/read/ted-books/the-terrorist-s-son" target="_blank">his astonishing first-person account</a> of a family engulfed by events much larger than them.</p>
<p>We think you&#8217;ll find <em>The Terrorist’s Son: A Story of Choice</em> a truly riveting read: The remarkable true story of a boy trained to hate, and the man who chose another path.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re publishing <em>The Terrorist&#8217;s Son</em> with our partner, Simon &amp; Schuster. It&#8217;s the first in a series of 12 books we&#8217;ll release over the next 12 months in hardcover, e-book and audiobook. These books cover a wide, TED-like range of subjects &#8212; from architecture to business, space travel to love. Each is intentionally short, up to 20,000 words: Long enough to dive deep into an idea, but short enough to be read in a single sitting. Many will include wondrous photography and art. All will bring new ideas and sharp writing to you monthly.</p>
<p>The books will have their own signature look, with cover art designed by legendary book jacket artist (<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/chip_kidd_designing_books_is_no_laughing_matter_ok_it_is">and TED speaker</a>) Chip Kidd. Among the forthcoming titles from TED Books: Acclaimed travel writer Pico Iyer’s <em>The Art of Stillness</em> will pose a counterintuitive truth: the more technology connects us, the more we feel desperate to unplug; Architizer founder Marc Kushner takes us on a global tour of groundbreaking advances in architecture in <em>The Future of Architecture in 100 Buildings</em>; and in the <em>Mathematics of Love</em>, Hannah Fry offers us patterns, proofs and the search for the ultimate equation.</p>
<p>We’re excited to see how these books help speakers go beyond their 18 minutes, and how they’ll help you dive deeper into their important ideas.</p>

<p>There are 365 days in a year. So it feels like a telling coincidence that the organizers of both TEDxCapeTown and TEDxJohannesburg—independently organized events in two of the biggest, busiest cities in South Africa—opted to hold their events within a single week.</p>
<p>This confluence of timing shows just how powerful the <a href="http://www.ted.com/attend/tedx-events" target="_blank">TEDx</a> platform is for creating new dialogues in South Africa, a country that just celebrated the 20th anniversary of the end of apartheid and its first free democratic elections. Since the start of the TEDx program in 2009, South Africa has become home to more than 100 events, many of them successful year after year, creating loyal communities dedicated to local ideas worth spreading.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://tedxcapetown.org/" target="_blank">TEDxCapeTown</a>, held August 16 and 17, the theme “Design Your Thinking” put the emphasis on audience collaboration. Organizer Justin Beswick and his team created a “big push for deep engagement,” starting with the attendee application process. “We wanted to make sure that people took the time to put some introspection and some of themselves into it,” says Beswick. “We want people who are going to not just be passive listeners.”</p>
<p>The crux of the Design Your Thinking theme was encouraging audience members to use the ideas presented at the event to reconsider their perspectives on their surroundings. As the TEDxCapeTown website puts it, “We all have our own filters and lenses through which we view the world. We all posses the ability to alter our perceptions and design the way we think.” Speakers like Nicola Jackman, a “joy catalyst” who brings laughter to children in hospitals, and Justin Smith, Woolworth’s Head of Sustainability who’s on a mission for responsible retail, provided ample food for thought. And, so that attendees could design their thinking together, a Saturday of talks was followed by a Sunday of workshops.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://www.tedxjohannesburg.com/" target="_blank">TEDxJohannesburg</a>, which took place on August 21, the focus was on the metropolis’ position as a global city. Themed “We the People,” the event drew heavily on the city’s past as well as on its current character. Kelo Kubu, the event’s organizer, explains, “The city was founded by people coming here from all over the world to look for gold. There’s not much gold left, but people are still coming from all over the world because the city is the economic hub of the continent. We want that to be reflected in the event, that the kind of ideas that come out of Johannesburg are not just specific to the city, but reflect that global reach.”</p>
<div id="attachment_91718" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-91718 size-full" src="http://tedconfblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/14850629840_cf510b2f85_k.jpg?w=900&#038;h=599" alt="14850629840_cf510b2f85_k" width="900" height="599" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Signage. Photo: Courtesy of TEDxJohannesburg</p></div>
<p>The event took not just a global lens, but a historical one too. Focusing on “20 years of democracy,” the event sought to reach across the generational gap, bringing together people who’d known very different South Africas. The speaker lineup included Tony Leon, a former leader of the opposition in South African parliament, along with the twentysomething Mandla Maseko, winner of a sub-orbital trip into space, who was only an infant when South Africa held its first elections in 1994. “The essence was,” says Kubu, “let’s look at the people of this country and what they’ve been up to the past 20 years, and ask, ‘What can we look forward to?’”</p>
<p>The community that’s grown up around TEDxJohannesburg is a cosmopolitan, international one. “It’s mainly people from corporations, financial centers, more academia,” says Kubu. “It’s also a bit mixed in terms of where people come from. It’s people who are in South Africa on some short-term projects from Europe, people from the US, and people from other parts of the continent.” Both the audience and the speakers are representative of the rapid pace of change in Johannesburg. “People come and go,” she says. “People are always coming in, and then they move on to other parts of the world. So it’s not a static community, it’s a community that’s always reinventing itself.”</p>
<p>Kubu also organizes a second TEDx event within Johannesburg, <a href="http://www.tedxsoweto.co.za/" target="_blank">TEDxSoweto</a>, which takes place in an area of the city famous for its historical role in uprisings against apartheid. “It’s two completely different communities. Even though both are in geographically the same city, they address different audiences,” she says. “TEDxSoweto is younger, more on the creative side, and in our programming we look more to issues that are rooted in the community.”</p>
<p>This year’s Soweto event is coming up in November. Though past themes were somewhat dreamier odes to creativity and future thinking, this year has a pragmatic tone with “Silver Linings”—a call to find hope even in the country’s social and economic ills.</p>
<div id="attachment_91727" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-91727" src="http://tedconfblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/tedxsoweto.jpg?w=900&#038;h=555" alt="A volunteer mans the registration table at TEDxSoweto.

<p>Though these three TEDx events may have different audiences and different goals, a powerful theme emerges between them, and a particularly South African one at that: breaking down barriers. In a country that’s in many ways still rebuilding its society from the apartheid era, dismantling those old social structures is a work in progress. “Cape Town is very cliquey,” says Beswick. “There are still a lot of silos we want to break down. That’s something that TED is able to do because it’s got different disciplines coming together.”</p>
<p>One big barrier to break: the line between urban and rural. When asked how well-known the TEDx movement is in South Africa, both Beswick and Kubu agreed that while it has become ubiquitous in cities and professional circles, there is still a long way to go to before the community is accessible to all. “You attract a certain demographic automatically,” says Beswick. “People who are kind of switched-on, tech-savvy—they’ve got good bandwidth. That’s not the broader demographic of South Africa.”</p>
<p>For Beswick, a key to spreading the TEDx mission is not only to grow and strengthen TEDxCapeTown, but to share the TEDx tools widely around the region, encouraging smaller communities to hold events. Beswick and his team are asking their attendees for help with this. “The idea is to get people to host their own events. We’re creating the tools and processes that allow people to host an event by getting all that they need from a mobile phone.”</p>
<p>Kubu echoes Beswick’s concern. “Most all of the [TEDx events in South Africa] have been in big cities,” she notes, “in Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban, Pretoria, Bloemfontein. And if not, it’s been university events.” The kind of rural events that have happened <a href="http://blog.ted.com/2014/08/13/how-tedx-is-spreading-through-rural-colombia/" target="_blank">elsewhere in the world</a>, and elsewhere on the continent, have still to catch on in South Africa. For both Beswick and Kubu, this shift is critical to helping all of South Africa have the kind of attitude-changing conversations that they’ve seen in their own communities.</p>
<p>For now, though, it’s just about finding and nurturing great ideas. Kubu feels that she’s learned much from her time as a TEDx organizer in South Africa, but that the core of those lessons is simple: “A lot of people have good ideas, but it’s very hard to synthesize them, to just focus in and narrow them down and say, ‘This is it!’”</p>
<p>Beswick’s takeaway is, most of all, the joy of doing what he does. “What I love the most out of anything,” he says, “is meeting other people, no matter who they are, who are interested in ideas that can change the world.”</p>
