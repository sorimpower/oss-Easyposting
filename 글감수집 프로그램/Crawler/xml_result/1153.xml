    <title>CUBI: A User Experience Model for Project Success

    <title>The Who, What, When, Wear, and Why of Wearable Technology

And just as we shifted our mindset to &lt;a href=&quot;/topics/iphone&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;iPhone&lt;/a&gt;’s smaller screen and learned to leverage new usage contexts, we need to adjust our midset once again for wearables—where screens get even smaller, and the &lt;a href=&quot;/topics/interaction-design&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;interaction&lt;/a&gt; window shrinks even more. Apple’s recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/watch/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt; unveiling confirms that wearables are here to stay—all major players are in and the game has started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Diving Deeper&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, it’s important to realize that the term “wearables” is a bit misleading, as it combines hundreds of...&lt;a href=&quot;http://uxmag.com/articles/the-who-what-when-wear-and-why-of-wearable-technology&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

But many product designers don’t realize that design can also be used as an effective strategy when it comes to positioning a new product. In this excerpt taken from my upcoming book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://femgineer.com/transform-ideas/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;How to Transform Ideas into Software Products&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, you’ll learn about companies that have effectively positioned based on design, and how to evaluate a competitor’s design to position your own offering.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of last year, my best friend Jessica got engaged to her longtime boyfriend, Ben. Since I do a lot of public speaking, she requested that I officiate the wedding. I was honored to accept, but I had never officiated a wedding before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remembered a couple of my friends mentioning that they had officiated weddings, and in order to get authorization, they just went online and...&lt;a href=&quot;http://uxmag.com/articles/differentiating-with-design&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

On the other hand, if someone else gets it there first, people are happy to use what is available and help to improve it with feedback as it grows. People have been struggling with these opposing interests long enough that we thought it important to outline a better way to think about the problem, depending on what stage your company is in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to remember that this is only a framework and that your actual course of action will be as personal as your business and products. But if you’re simply trying to “wedge in” design excellence while rushing your product to market, then you&#039;re already on the wrong path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Competing Priorities: Experience vs. Execution&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Experience&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;UX is absolutely...&lt;a href=&quot;http://uxmag.com/articles/balancing-product-ux-and-lean-execution&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Their challenge:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Submissions must be drawn by hand and tell a good story. Winners will be selected by the authors and will receive a print edition of &lt;em&gt;Drawing Ideas&lt;/em&gt; along with a stencil from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uistencils.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UI Stencils&lt;/a&gt;.

Families can use &lt;a href=&quot;/topics/analytics-and-tracking&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;analytic&lt;/a&gt; tools to drill down through their own financial data to see where their money goes and how to cut spending. These tools have made every aspect of financial management—including transfers, payments—incredibly intuitive and easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the financial services sector got left behind when the digital revolution hit. Now they need to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since automatic teller machines were first rolled out in the 1960s, followed by internet banking in the 1990s and mobile banking in the late 2000s, consumers...&lt;a href=&quot;http://uxmag.com/articles/why-banks-need-to-revamp-their-user-experience&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Increasingly, our goal may be &lt;a href=&quot;/topics/emotion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;emotional&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;I want to feel a certain way&lt;/em&gt;).

    <title>What Should Experience Designers Understand About Developers?

&lt;p&gt;Though the work &lt;a href=&quot;/topics/design&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;designers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/topics/development&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;developers&lt;/a&gt; do in digital &lt;a href=&quot;/topics/product-design&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;product design&lt;/a&gt; is directly related, there is often a disconnect between the two roles. While the occasional &lt;a href=&quot;https://uxmag.com/articles/unicorn-shmunicorn-be-a-pegasus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;purple unicorn&lt;/a&gt; can bridge the divide and work effectively in both realms, there remains some shadowy confusion about...&lt;a href=&quot;http://uxmag.com/articles/what-should-experience-designers-understand-about-developers&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>No Bottom Line? No Experience:Finding the balance between user needs and business needs
</title>

&lt;p&gt;UX practitioners certainly have a lot to be proud of, but when we get caught up in the swell of all this excitement, it’s easy to forget the business needs that underpin the work we do. Experience design can be costly, after all, and it’s most often the economic interests of businesses that fuel and fund the creation of experience-driven technologies. Much in the same way that different design teams use different strategies to create...&lt;a href=&quot;http://uxmag.com/articles/no-bottom-line-no-experience&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The same year, I decided to pursue a curious product passion of mine: democratizing the conference room with a portable, modular, dry-erase board system.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; I went through SolidWorks courses to immerse myself in &lt;a href=&quot;/topics/design-tools-and-software&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CAD&lt;/a&gt;. I purchased a large-format, high-resolution 3D printer to build &lt;a href=&quot;/topics/prototypes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;prototypes&lt;/a&gt;. I believed I was equipped to create an amazing product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few months later, I felt confident entering the small, windowless conference room of a local plastic injection company. I sat at a blue pop-up kitchen table with mismatched chairs around it. The wallpaper in the room was peeling and the floors were covered in old peel-and-stick laminate. The room was a far cry from the large enterprise conference rooms I’ve been in hundreds of times,...&lt;a href=&quot;http://uxmag.com/articles/six-things-physical-product-development-taught-me-about-experience-design&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
