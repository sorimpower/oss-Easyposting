				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-258187" src="http://betanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ladycovering-600x525.jpg" alt="ladycovering" width="600" height="525" /></p>
<p>Seeing nude celebrities is an exciting thing; I get it. When I was a younger man, I might have partaken in the consumption of the Fappening photos. However, with maturity comes empathy and I cannot enjoy seeing photos that a woman doesn't want seen. In other words, I respect a woman's right to privacy and would feel awful to contribute to her feelings of embarrassment and betrayal.</p>
<p>The Fappening is a tragedy and like all tragedies, learning from them can mitigate the negative aspect. If we can walk away from the photo leak as a more evolved people, we can prevent the hackers from "winning". With that said, here are three things that can be learned from <a title="The Fappening is more than just nude celebrity pics" href="http://betanews.com/2014/09/01/the-fappening-is-more-than-just-nude-celebrity-pics-can-we-trust-apples-icloud/" target="_blank">the Fappening</a>.</p>
<p><strong>1.) In the Cloud, nothing is safe</strong> -- No, I don't just mean iCloud. Sure, Apple's service was a source of some leaks, but it could have happened to any company. Ultimately, nothing in the cloud can be considered 100 percent safe and secure.</p>
<p>Sadly, the response by many on the Internet is that the women are sluts and whores and it is their fault for taking nude photos in the first place. This thinking is backwards as we should never blame victims, but also, the naked body is not a dirty thing. If a woman decides to take a photo of herself, no one else has the right to decide what is or isn't tasteless. No one is to blame, other than the hackers that leaked the photos.</p>
<p>Going forward, it should always be assumed that what you share in the cloud could <a title="Your personal porn is public" href="http://betanews.com/2014/09/01/your-personal-porn-is-public/" target="_blank">possibly be compromised</a>. This is sad, as the cloud makes things easier to access, but privacy is the unfortunate trade-off for convenience.</p>
<p><strong>2.) Sexism is alive and well</strong> -- Did you see the nudes of Robert De Niro? What about Bryan Cranston? Surely you saw LeBron James, right? No, you did not see <em>any</em> nude men in the Fappening or <a title="The Fappening part 2 -- More naked celebrity photos leaked" href="http://betanews.com/2014/09/21/the-fappening-part-2-more-naked-celebrity-photos-leaked/" target="_blank">Fappening 2</a>. It seems that hackers were only interested in obtaining female photos.</p>
<p>Sure, this can easily be explained by saying that the hackers are heterosexual males that just aren't interested in male celebrities. However, it can also be argued that women are more sexualized than men in modern society. So am I saying that I want to see a nude Will Smith in order to have equality? No. I would prefer that no one had their privacy violated. Still, it seems that sexism is still here.</p>
<p><strong>3.) Not everyone on the Internet sucks</strong> -- If you spend five minutes on 4chan or any other online forum, you would probably think that society has broken down and the Apocalypse is near. However, not everyone is an anonymous, deranged, psychopath. Since the Fappening happened, many people, both male and female, have condemned the leaking of the photos. In other words, there are still sensible people on the Internet.</p>
<p>To prove that there are still good people on the web, I ask you to please leave a comment stating that you pledge to abstain from looking at leaked photos. Let's show the world that nobility still exists.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258256" src="http://betanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/shellshock_800_theader_contentfullwidth.jpg" alt="shellshock_800_theader_contentfullwidth" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p>A worrying new security vulnerability means that all Apple Mac computers, about half of all websites, and even internet connected home appliances are all vulnerable to hackers. Security experts are saying it's even worse than this year's Heartbleed fiasco. But what is Shellshock exactly, and what does it mean for the security of your business?</p>
<p>Shellshock exploits a vulnerability in Bash. Bash, an acronym for Bourne Again Shell, is a command-line shell used by many UNIX computers. UNIX is an operating system on which many others are built, such as Linux and Mac OS. So if any part of your business runs on a Unix-based operating system, it could be vulnerable.</p>
<p>Bash is a key component of the web servers that run at least half of the websites on the internet, so if downtime on your website is a concern, you need to get yourself protected. Even if you don't use any aspect of Linux yourself, a huge proportion of the Internet runs on the "backbone" of Apache, which uses Bash heavily. Bash is also used in the background by web browsers, email apps, FTP (website upload) apps and all kinds of other applications.</p>
<p>If you're not sure if your website is supported by Apache, contact your server operators and find out. Check that they are enacting a patch that will keep the criminals away from your website.</p>
<p>The real problem is just how easy it is to do. It only takes about three lines of code to attack a vulnerable server, which means attacks based on the vulnerability are well within the reach of even pedestrian hackers and cybercriminals.</p>
<p>Any sensitive files also need to be audited and secured, if you believe you could be compromised. Not only does Shellshock allow hackers to read information, it can write, copy and delete files -- and worst of all, run programs, without the user ever knowing it's happened. Anything that your business couldn't operate without -- that is, your highest priority in terms of data security -- might need to be taken off the network until the vulnerability is fixed.</p>
<p>If your data really can't be compromised, it's worth copying your sensitive data to a USB key or CD (with multiple copies for backup), and remove them from networked computers. Businesses should also be on heightened alert: they should look to their monitoring and web application firewalls to look out for any attacks.</p>
<p>For Mac users, you should look for the latest update to OS X, which hasn't arrived yet -- but should be coming soon. As for the rest of the Internet -- let's hope it gets fixed soon!</p>

<p>This year's Ryder Cup in Scotland is one of the most technologically advanced golfing events, thanks to the introduction of Radio Frequency Identification Technology (RFIT).</p>
<p>Spectators receive a special wristband with their tickets which allows them to take part in various activities around the course, such as the BMW car display, the Ryder Cup Experience with Standard Life Investments and the 'Walk the Course' competition from Active Scotland.</p>
<p>Fans are be able to share their experiences on social media, touch the wristband on several points throughout the course to register on a supporters' leaderboard and show support for their team in the form of a virtual 'high five'.</p>
<p>The bands can also be used as a method of cashless payment at certain locations around the famous Gleneagles course.</p>
<p>Antonia Beggs, operations director for the 2014 Ryder Cup, said, "Ryder Cup Europe and the key stakeholders wanted to deliver the best possible spectator experience. As social media, smartphones and mobile internet have become a part of everyday life, the RFID technology seemed a natural choice to lift the event beyond the standard set previously".</p>
<p>The radio technology embedded in the wristband contains information about the wearer which can be uploaded to the tournament website when the ticketholder registers their band.</p>
<p>"Our RFID wristbands will mark The 2014 Ryder Cup out as something completely different to what has gone before in terms of interaction with spectators, media and indeed anyone visiting the course," said Serge Grimaux of Intellitix, the firm providing the wristbands.</p>
<p>"The technology is totally secure and has been proven at a number of large scale events across the world".</p>
<p>Team Europe are looking to defend their crown at this year’s competition, having narrowly beaten team America thanks to a dramatic late comeback at the 2012 Ryder Cup in Illinois.</p>

Hello, Ello?" width="320" height="320" />It's very easy -- some would say fun -- to bash social networks. MySpace was a very easy target, and <a href="http://betanews.com/2014/09/03/twitter-ceo-says-its-your-own-fault-you-see-tweets-from-people-you-dont-follow/">Twitter comes in for criticism</a> from <a href="http://betanews.com/2014/08/23/twitter-may-be-within-its-rights-to-block-isis-beheading-content-but-is-it-right/">time to time</a>, but it's <a href="http://betanews.com/2014/09/13/facebooks-real-name-policy-is-wrong-discriminatory-and-potentially-dangerous/">Facebook that tends to bear the brunt</a> of people's ire. Mark Zuckerberg's social (advertising) network hits the headlines quite frequently, but it's been on the lips of many in recent weeks after starting to aggressively implement its "real name" policy. It's something that initially <a href="http://betanews.com/2014/09/13/facebooks-real-name-policy-is-wrong-discriminatory-and-potentially-dangerous/">upset drag artists</a> around the world but it's also something that affecting musicians and other artists who have opted to use a stage name. In recent days another name has bubbled to the surface. It's not brand new, but <a href="https://ello.co/">Ello</a> has been hard to avoid over the last few days. What’s going on?</p>
<p>It's clear that the fallout from the <a href="http://betanews.com/2014/09/13/facebooks-real-name-policy-is-wrong-discriminatory-and-potentially-dangerous/">drag artist incident</a> that social network users have been seeking out new homes where they are free to be whatever they want to be. This is something that Ello seems to offer. If you want to hide behind a pseudonym, adopt a different online persona, run multiple account under different names, pretend to be someone else, or just smirk at the fact you can call yourself Farty McPoopButt if you feel so inclined, you're onto a winner here.</p>
<p>The site may not be new, but it's certainly in its infancy -- it only sprang into existence this year. Starting life as a "private social network", Ello expanded to a public network. But one with quite a difference: no ads. Ello thinks "ads are tacky" and has <a href="https://ello.co/wtf/post/why-no-ads">committed to remaining ad-free</a> -- so confident are the founders that this will remain the case, a prominent Delete Account button is provide in settings so you can walk away if anything you don’t like should happen.</p>
<p>The page that explains the "no ads" policy does give away a glimpse of what's to come. "Ello is completely free to use". Well that's a good start. "Very soon we will begin offering special features to our users." Sounds good to me... count me in, you cheeky little scamps! "If we create a special feature that you like, you can choose to pay a very small amount of money to add it to your Ello account forever." Ah... there's the rub. Well, one of the rubs.</p>
<p>Ello has an air of Apple to it; old-school Apple, admittedly, but there's a distinctly Apple-y feel to everything. The word "beautiful" is bandied about as if it's an adword. The site is young, but you're given little control over the look and feel of things. The stark simplicity is something that you'll either fall in love with, or loathe with a passion -- <a href="http://betanews.com/2014/08/27/there-is-simply-no-reason-for-anyone-to-care-about-the-iphone-6/">much like Apple's products</a>. Ello is like stepping back in time. Forget fancy extras. Forget options. This is stripped-back social networking. At the moment, even the user-base is stripped-back. The fact that Ello is currently invite-only (but getting hold of an invite is not hard) helps to increase intrigue levels, but also create a semi-elitist niche network that will appeal to a certain type of social networker.</p>
<p>Ello is currently riding the wave generated by the public, and celebrity, outcry at Facebook. It's too early to tell whether site with weather the storm, whether it will cope with an influx of new users, or if users will stick around. There's a bit of an echo there at the moment, but word seems to be spreading. Is it cool? Is it hipster? There's a <a href="https://ello.co/wtf/post/manifesto">manifesto</a>, comrade. Is it anti-cool? Gawd knows... but it something of a mini-phenomenon at the moment. Maybe it will remain the domain of freaks, geeks, hipsters and musicians.</p>

<p>Finding more capable editors can be a real problem, but there are a few around, and <a title="ocenaudio" href="http://www.downloadcrew.com/article/32640-ocenaudio" target="_blank">ocenaudio</a> is a very interesting example.</p>
<p><span id="more-37915"></span>The program is available for Windows, Mac and Linux, and is entirely free, no adware or other hassles. Just install it and you’re ready to go in seconds.</p>
<p>Ocenaudio’s first plus is its extensive file support. It can handle a wide range of audio formats (regular, raw and text-based), videos, URLs, folders, playlists or archives, and you can open files individually or via drag and drop.</p>
<p class="size-medium wp-image-37916" style="border: 0px none;" title="Ocenaudio">Whatever you’ve selected is initially displayed in a standard waveform view. But you can also switch to a spectral view, or display both, one above the other.</p>
<p>Navigation is generally very easy. Spinning the mouse wheel zooms in and out, while a separate pane shows where the current view is located within the file. If you want to look elsewhere, there’s none of the usual zoom full/ reselect/ zoom in again; instead you can just move your zoom window by clicking and dragging.</p>
<p>Basic selection is just as simple: click and drag across the waveform. But there’s more here, too. Hold down Ctrl, click/ drag/ release again and you’ll select multiple areas. Click Play and it’ll play those selections alone, optionally looping through them.</p>
<p>Once you’ve chosen an area then there are plenty of functions and effects to explore. You might trim, cut, copy or paste audio, apply fades, gain, normalize, filters, equalizers, delay/ flanger/ chorus/ reverb/ vibrato, compressor/ expander/ limiter/ noise gate, and the list goes on.</p>
<p>What’s really smart, though, is that each of these offers real-time previewing. Choose the 31-band equalizer, say, and you can leave your sample playing on a loop, then adjust each band individually, and hear the results right away.</p>
<p>And of course if you’ve selected multiple areas then your chosen effect will be applied to them all: a real time-saver.</p>
<p>This isn’t everything ocenaudio has to offer. In fact you could make a good audio tool from the features we haven’t mentioned so far: FFT analysis, sample rate conversion, swap/ extract channel operations, DTMF detection/ generation, a tag editor, iPhone ringtone creator, FTP export and more.</p>
<p>Put it all together and <a title="ocenaudio" href="http://www.downloadcrew.com/article/32640-ocenaudio" target="_blank">ocenaudio</a> is an impressive audio editor, easy to use for basic operations, yet with plenty of extras on hand if you need them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-255805" src="http://betanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Apple-iPhone-6-Plus-600x337.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 6 Plus" width="600" height="337" /></p>
<p>Apple makes amazing products and software, but every company is bound to make a mistake. Unfortunately, iOS 8.0.1 was quite the doozy. You see, the update crippled the brand new iPhone 6 and 6 Plus by taking away the ability to make phone calls and use the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. Apple was responsible however, and pulled the update very quickly. Before the update was removed, many people had already applied it and found themselves in dire straits.</p>
<p>Losing the ability to make phone calls is not only annoying but extremely dangerous too. Forget about the teens that just want to talk about gossip and the mall, and consider medical professionals that depend on communication or a stranded mother on the side of the road. Today, Apple rights a wrong and releases iOS 8.0.2 which undoes the damage of the previous release and introduces other bug fixes too. Kudos to the company for fixing the bug so quickly.</p>
<p>Apple lists the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixes an issue in iOS 8.0.1 that impacted cellular network connectivity and Touch ID on iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus</li>
<li>Fixes a bug so HealthKit apps can now be made available on the App Store</li>
<li>Addresses an issue where 3rd party keyboards could become deselected when a user enters their passcode</li>
<li>Fixes an issue that prevented some apps from accessing photos from the Photo Library</li>
<li>Improves the reliability of the Reachability feature on iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus</li>
<li>Fixes an issue that could cause unexpected cellular data usage when receiving SMS/MMS messages</li>
<li>Better support of Ask To Buy for Family Sharing for In-App Purchases</li>
<li>Fixes an issue where ringtones were sometimes not restored from iCloud backups</li>
<li>Fixes a bug that prevented uploading photos and videos from Safari</li>
</ul>
<p>While I unfortunately do not have an iPhone 6 to test with the update, I do have an iPad Air. I am currently downloading the update, but it is going very slow, as I am guessing Apple's servers are getting hit hard. If you have an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus and update to iOS 8.0.2, please tell me in the comments if your cellular connection is working without issue.</p>

<p>Building desktops is a hobby I still enjoy, even if the younger crowd tends to gravitate towards tablets. Don't get me wrong, I love both the Surface Pro 3 and iPad Air, but there is something satisfying about building something on your own. I particularly like selecting each and every component, like a solid state drive, so that it is uniquely my own.</p>
<p>Lately, the prices of solid state drives have been dropping, but don't be fooled; SATA III is saturated, meaning most drives on the market will soon be obsolete. The future you see, is drives that connect directly to PCIe in a card format. Yes, your future SSD may look like a USB card or sound card. Today, Samsung announces a piece of tech that is sure to excite many nerds -- a 3.2TB PCIe SSD. Whoa.</p>
<p>"Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., the world leader in advanced memory technology, today announced that it has started mass producing 3.2-terabyte (TB) NVMe PCIe solid state drives (SSDs) based on its 3D V-NAND (Vertical NAND) flash memory technology, for use in high-end enterprise server systems. The new NVMe PCIe SSD, SM1715, utilizes Samsung's proprietary 3D V-NAND in an HHHL (half-height, half-length) card-type form factor, to offer 3.2TB of storage capacity -- doubling Samsung’s previous highest NVMe SSD density of 1.6TB", says Samsung.</p>
<p>The manufacturer further explains, "the newly introduced 3.2TB NVMe SSD provides a sequential read speed of 3,000 megabytes per second (MB/s) and writes sequentially at up to 2,200MB/s. It also randomly reads at up to 750,000 IOPS (input output operations per second) and writes randomly at up to 130,000 IOPS. In addition, the 3.2TB SM1715 features outstanding reliability with 10 DWPDs (drive writes per day) for five years. This provides a level of reliability that enterprise server manufacturers have been requesting for their high-end storage solutions".</p>
<p>Good lord, the speed of this card is pure insanity! However, before you get too excited, please know that pricing and availability is unknown. Samsung is only just starting to manufacture this beast, and I expect it to be quite expensive. For the majority of consumers, it will likely be unattainable due to cost.</p>
<p>Still, it is exciting to see solid state drives achieve such monstrous capacity and speed. Hell, with a SSD at 3.2TB, we should probably start writing the eulogy for the traditional hard drive, right?</p>

<p>A week ago, in a letter to the European Commission, News Corps complained that Google is a <a href="http://betanews.com/2014/09/18/news-corp-google-is-a-platform-for-piracy-with-cynical-management/">'platform for piracy' with 'cynical management'</a>. Today, having gathered together its ammunition, <a href="http://googlepolicyeurope.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/dear-rupert_25.html">Google responds with a letter</a> of its own. Although News Corp's letter was signed by CEO Robert Thomson, Google's reply starts with the salutation "Dear Rupert" -- addressing CEO Rupert Murdoch -- and the search giant picks apart the complaints levelled at it. One of New Corp's key complaints centered around the idea that Google is riddled with pirated material, and "unlawful and unsavory content", and this is one of the first ideas that Google shoots down.</p>
<p>Countering accusations of being a platform for piracy, SVP Global Communications, Rachel Whetstone, points to the 222 million copyright infringing websites that were delisted last year. The existence of copyright protecting ContentID technology to help detect infringing footage on YouTube is also cited, as is efficiency in weeding out inappropriate contents such as sexual images of children.</p>
<p>News Corp had also complained that Google used its dominant market position to stifle competition, but Google has a response to this as well. "We are not the gatekeeper to the web, as some claim," says Whetstone, going on to point out that Google has lots of competition itself. While Google is somewhat of a Swiss army knife for the web, there are plenty of specialist services and Google's letter rightly points out that many web users jump directly to websites without using the search engine as a middleman.</p>
<p>The letter also addresses some of News Corp's more bizarre accusations, including the notion that Google's certification process for Android apps gives the company "the freedom to develop competing products". Google says that certifying apps is a necessary process to help ensure security and compatibility, and points out that there are competing app stores available for the platform that users are free to turn to. After refuting suggestions that preference is given to YouTube videos in search results, Google takes a swipe at News Corp's complaint that it is leading to a "less informed, more vexatious level of dialogue in our society" -- which is a pretty rich coming from a dangerously rightwing media beast responsible for Fox News.</p>
<p>So now blows have been traded in both directions; the ball is now in News Corp's court. It'll be interesting to see whether there is another letter from the Murdoch empire in a week's time and if this descends into a tit for tat exchange that drags on indefinitely.</p>

It is unclear whether this could lead to a ban on Xiaomi's low-priced smartphones in Taiwan.

<p>Xiaomi has found itself under scrutiny due to concerns that it may be a security threat, with the Taiwanese government expected to make a decision on the smartphone company within three months. It is unclear whether this could lead to a ban on Xiaomi's low-priced smartphones in Taiwan.</p>
<p>A statement on the website of Taiwan's executive branch on Tuesday referred to the fact that some of the company's smartphones automatically send user data back to the Xiaomi servers in Beijing, resulting in a risk of security breaches.</p>
<p>Both Chinese businesses and government are regularly accused of cyber and industrial espionage, and the move by Taiwan is another case of this.</p>
<p>Taiwan -- a breakaway province -- is a subject of debate amongst commentators concerned with its over reliance on the mainland. Critics of Beijing claim that China's expanding economic ties give the growing power influence over its smaller neighbor’s staunchly democratic politics.</p>
<p>Japanese instant messaging service Line, owned by South Korea's Naver Corp, will also be banned on government work-related computers due to security fears, the report said.</p>
<p>While a Line spokeswoman based in Tokyo told Reuters that the company is investigating the issue, Xiaomi declined to comment.</p>
<p>It's not the first time Xiaomi has been implicated in concerns over data access. Accusations that surfaced recently drove the firm to upgrade its OS and to give users an opt-out option of data collection from address books.</p>
<p>Although its consumer base mainly resides in China, the low-cost smartphone maker now has a presence in India, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, with further expansion earmarked for Thailand, Mexico and Brazil.</p>
<p>Taiwan is seen by Beijing as a renegade province, though trade ties have increased dramatically between the two regions in recent years.</p>

<p>Flying is terrifying for me, which is arguably illogical. Plane crashes are fairly rare, but turbulence still causes me to wet my pants (no, not literally). What tends to calm me is knowing that a professional pilot is in charge of the plane, and is using the best technology.</p>
<p>Unfortunately my choice for the best tablet, the Surface Pro 3, was not previously permitted for use as an electronic flight bag for pilots during the entire flight (an EFB is a device used for performing flight management tasks). This changes today however, as both the FAA and EASA give Microsoft a big thumbs-up, and authorizes it for uninterrupted in-flight use.</p>
<p>"Today, we're announcing that Surface Pro 3 has qualified for authorization for use as an EFB during all phases of flight, as defined by both the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Through this assessment process, Surface Pro 3 completed rigorous environmental and situational tests, satisfying a lengthy and important part of the FAA authorization process. Now, when airlines look to select the feature-rich Surface Pro 3 for their EFB initiatives, deployment timelines will be significantly decreased, and the device itself may be used to its full computing potential, versus serving just as a simple document reader", <a title="SP3 weeee! Flying" href="http://blog.surface.com/2014/09/microsoft-announces-surface-pro-3-qualification-for-faaeasa-authorization/" target="_blank">says</a> Cyril Belikoff, Senior Director, Microsoft Surface.</p>
<p>Belikoff further explains, "we are also announcing today that navAero is now part of the Designed for Surface (DFS) accessory partner program and will build a mount that enables Surface Pro 3 to connect to onboard power and data systems in the cockpit. Not just a paper replacement device, this new solution lets airlines enable a true connected cockpit experience and so much more".</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/t-bVxJN4QW8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Pilots have people's lives in their hands, and passengers deserve to have a pilot empowered with the best technology. By gaining unceasing access to the Surface Pro 3, they can be more productive. More importantly, the larger screen should allow pilots to consume content in a more enjoyable way, with less eye strain.</p>

<p>The success of the <a href="http://www.thelegomovie.com/" target="_blank">The Lego Movie</a> released earlier this year is testament to the cross-generational appeal of Lego -- its popularity has remained steadfast over the last few generations -- and it will certainly remain relevant in the next generations to come. Without a doubt, Lego is one of the most popular toys of all time. Lego engages people of all ages because it offers <em>unlimited building possibilities.</em> As the Lego pieces interlock in infinite ways, you have the ability to create whatever you like.</p>
<p>So how does this relate to the world of enterprise? Over the last few years the financial world has witnessed the rise of "Financial Lego" API solutions for the enterprise, built by specialized FinTech firms. In other words, there are now many FinTech firms which focus on particular segments of the financial value chain such as international transfers or payroll processing. These technology firms optimize these processes so that they are more efficient, more convenient and less expensive than banks or other traditional institutions -- and are offered up as bespoke services to businesses through APIs.</p>
<p>With Financial Lego APIs, IT leaders within businesses can create their own financial IT solution or support other processes within their organization without having to build every piece of the technology from scratch. Instead, they can mix and match a portfolio of financial technology APIs to create a bespoke solution. Here the development team can integrate the functionality of the APIs as part of their technology. APIs also enables internal innovation -- by using an API, developers can build additional applications around its data.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of Financial Lego APIs that are currently available:</p>
<p>For accepting online payments, there are the <a href="https://stripe.com/gb" target="_blank">Stripe</a> or <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/" target="_blank">Braintree</a> Lego APIs</p>
<p>For taking mobile payments, there are the <a href="http://www.zapp.co.uk/" target="_blank">Zapp</a> or <a href="http://www.mopowered.co.uk/" target="_blank">MoPowered</a> Lego APIs</p>
<p>For building a banking platform, there are the <a href="https://openbankproject.com/en/" target="_blank">Open Bank Project</a>, <a href="http://www.thecurrencycloud.com/news/blog/standardtreasury.com" target="_blank">Standard Treasury</a> or <a href="http://www.bancbox.com/" target="_blank">Bancbox</a> APIs</p>
<p>For managing the world of virtual currencies, there is the <a href="https://ripple.com/" target="_blank">Ripple</a> Lego API</p>
<p>Businesses looking to expand internationally will benefit immensely from these solutions. Working across different regions means understanding the different regulations for compliance and developing new banking relationships. While this is critical for the success of these processes, it proves to be especially difficult for IT leaders who do not come from a strictly financial services background. And from a security standpoint, Financial Lego APIs have benefits in that area as well as the data will remain in corporate servers and won’t be copied to any device -- it’s provided to the app only as needed.</p>
<p>Developers within IT departments can simply join together the most relevant technologies to support their financial goals. Working like this means IT departments don’t have to worry about many of the complications associated with getting solutions up and running --  because someone’s already done the heavy lifting and can lend the missing pieces.</p>
<p>FinTech firms developing Financial Lego API solutions offer simplicity in terms of removing redundant processes in the value chain and by being easy to plug into. They offer speed both in transaction time and 'go live' time. They offer transparency in pricing and business models. Finally, trust is paramount to these firms. They all invest heavily in compliance and security so that businesses can ensure that their processes are reliable.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Financial LegoAPIscan offer significant benefits for enterprise users looking to expand or improve their financial processes. Firms can launch or manage their financial services in new markets, bring products to market faster and ensure internal innovation all with Financial Lego APIs.</p>

He believes that the rise of self-service, online, instantaneous IT is fundamentally changing how the world conducts business, and that this is the most exciting time in the IT industry so far. His reasons for working at Currency Cloud are both noble ("we’re helping to facilitate international trade!") and unashamedly commercial ("we’re capable not just of growth but hyper-growth!").</em></p>

<p>Although it seems that the <a title="BetaNews - Heartbleed bug not exploited before disclosure" href="http://betanews.com/2014/09/10/heartbleed-bug-not-exploited-before-disclosure/" target="_blank">Heartbleed bug wasn't exploited</a> before its existence was disclosed, that doesn’t mean the security world can rest on its laurels.</p>
<p>The latest problem to be revealed is a bug in the commonly used Bash command interpreter that poses a critical risk to Linux and Unix systems. And since these form the backbone of the internet and are in many other systems as well it's a threat to the rest of us too.</p>
<p>The bug called Shellshock, discovered by Linux specialist Stephane Chazelas, is present in versions of Bash up to and including 4.3 and has potentially been there for many years. It poses a particular risk to Apache web servers. CGI scripts that use or invoke Bash are vulnerable to remote-code injection. This includes any child processes spawned by a script. OpenSSH and some DHCP clients are also affected on machines that use Bash.</p>
<p>Systems based on Debian -- including Ubuntu -- shouldn't be at risk since they use Dash. However, it's possible versions of Bash may be present so it's important that admins check which interpreters are installed and patch them if needed.</p>
<p>According to Darien Kindlund of security company <a title="FireEye - blog" href="http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/vulnerabilities/2014/09/the-big-bad-bash-bug.html%20" target="_blank">FireEye</a>, "It's worse than Heartbleed, in that it affects servers that help manage huge volumes of Internet traffic. Conservatively, the impact is anywhere from 20 to 50 percent of global servers supporting web pages".</p>
<p>A further problem is that Apple systems use Bash as the basis of their command line Terminal program. In addition Robert Graham of <a title="Errata Security" href="http://blog.erratasec.com/2014/09/bash-bug-as-big-as-heartbleed.html" target="_blank">Errata Security</a> warns that, "Internet-of-things devices like video cameras are especially vulnerable because a lot of their software is built from web-enabled bash scripts. Thus, not only are they less likely to be patched, they are more likely to expose the vulnerability to the outside world".</p>
<p>Graham also notes, "Unlike Heartbleed, which only affected a specific version of OpenSSL, this Bash bug has been around for a long, long time. That means there are lots of old devices on the network vulnerable to this bug. The number of systems needing to be patched, but which won't be, is much larger than Heartbleed".</p>
<p>Linux distros have responded quickly and patches are already available for most major flavors. Apple had yet to respond at the time of writing but advice on testing for and responding to Shellshock is available at <a title="StackExchange" href="http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/146849/how-do-i-recompile-bash-to-avoid-the-remote-exploit-cve-2014-6271-and-cve-2014-7" target="_blank">StackExchange</a>.</p>
<p>Security company <a title="Secunia" href="http://secunia.com/" target="_blank">Secunia</a> has released an advisory saying that the patch issued by GNU -- the open source project behind Bash -- is ineffective but GNU is expected to "release another patch today due to the criticality of this vulnerability".</p>
<p>Security researchers <a title="Bromium Labs" href="http://www.bromium.com/labs.html" target="_blank">Bromium Labs</a> suggests that, "... this likely won't be the last vulnerability found in Bash. Application developers should try to avoid invoking shells unless absolutely necessary, or use minimalist shells where required".</p>

<p>The newest Apple "gate" is upon us. Many users complain that their new <a href="http://betanews.com/2014/09/24/if-your-iphone-6-or-6-plus-bends-its-apples-fault/" target="_blank">iPhones bend in the pants</a>. Flexible display is a compelling technology, <em>when designed that way</em>. Surely, Apple doesn't want customers, ah, adapting iPhone 6 and 6 Plus designs in their pockets. Someone call the lawyers! But wait, who sues whom? Apple for buyers violating its design patents, or users complaining the handsets are flawed? Oh, these legal quagmires are treacherous!</p>
<p>Personally, I'd like to do a gallery showing of bent iPhones as art. Maybe I can open a museum of pop culture here in San Diego. My point: There are some unseen benefits to Apple's apparent iPhone fiasco. Here, I present eight -- and surely there are many more. Please decorate our comment gallery with your additions.</p>
<p><strong>1. iPhone 6 and, particularly, 6 Plus supply shortages should subside or even end.</strong> Who wants to purchase a mobile that bends in the pocket, eh? Surely, lots of people thinking about the new Apple handsets are reconsidering and even canceling orders -- and thanking the deity of preference for sticking them in the waiting queue.</p>
<p><strong>2. Samsung advanced the Galaxy Note 4 launch date.</strong> It's Christmas in Korea, today! Sammy benefits from all the marketing promoting iPhone 6 Plus and <em>why</em> larger-screen handsets are better and all the negative press showing Apple's mobile to be not the one.</p>
<p><strong>3. Android fanboys get a good laugh -- the last one!</strong> I think they should adopt a universal wave. When, say, in Starbucks, someone pulls out iPhone 6 or 6 Plus, yank out that big Android, wave it in the air, and laugh. Snickering and head shaking are optional.</p>
<p><strong>4. All the bloggers and journalists who aren't Apple favorites can vent their resentment.</strong> We all know that the company keeps a shortlist of writers who get advance access to <em>everything</em>. For those that don't, here's their chance to stick it to Apple.</p>
<p><strong>5. Apple's blogger and journalist favorites can show they aren't shills.</strong> The time for them to write that <em>one</em> negative story is when there is some kind of "gate" -- Antennagate, Mapgate, and now bendgate/bentgate. These opportunities are so rare these writers shouldn't delay.</p>
<p><strong>6. The so-called iSheep have a chance to try something new.</strong> Their friends have told them for <em>years</em> that Android is better and recently that iPhone 6 is like a 2012 Google Nexus phone. At last, just maybe -- like an intervention for the family alcoholic -- they will give up their Apple addiction and try something else.</p>
<p><strong>7. Plastic is drastic.</strong> For years, iSheep have snickered about how much cooler are their metal iPhones compared to plasticky Androids. But in a series of bend tests -- and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znK652H6yQM" target="_blank">Lewis Hilsenteger's is the benchmark</a> -- plastic phones prove to be sturdier and highly resistant to pocket bends. Ain't that a shame.</p>
<p><strong>8. Apple lawyers will stay on the job longer.</strong> With the Apple-Samsung patent and ebook price-fixing cases winding down, the fruit-logo company doesn't need as many legal consultants. But, hey, another "gate" and the class-action lawsuits that follow is great job security for Apple lawyers.</p>

<p>Windows XP is still in use in a surprisingly high number of businesses. A recent survey suggests that more than half of organizations are still running it somewhere.</p>
<p>The survey was conducted by systems management specialist <a title="Adaptiva" href="http://www.adaptiva.com/" target="_blank">Adaptiva</a> among more than 100 TechEd North America attendees showed that 53 percent still had some XP systems.</p>
<p>Based on the company's experience in helping large enterprises migrate from XP using Microsoft’s System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM), Adaptiva has come up with five tips to ensure successful migration.</p>
<p>"It is very difficult for a large organization to move off of Windows XP completely, especially one with many operating locations around the globe," says Deepak Kumar, Founder and CTO of Adaptiva. "IT departments can begin taking steps now to ensure a smoother migration, whether moving from Windows XP or from Windows 7 to 8. Our 5 Tips come from successful enterprise migrations where they have reduced costs, slashed migration times, and improved success rates".</p>
<p>The tips for ensuring smooth migration are:</p>
<p><strong>1</strong> Optimize task sequences in order to plan for debugging and troubleshooting. Make use of logical phases -- called groups in task sequences -- so others can more easily monitor for success/failure, perform troubleshooting, and remediate. Plan ahead for debugging by saving log files to a network share, otherwise there will be no way to perform root cause analysis in the event of failure during the pre-OS phase.</p>
<p><strong>2</strong> Ensure the health of SCCM clients. The success of each migration depends on a healthy Windows system with a properly functioning SCCM client. Administrators need to be sure all the clients are problem-free in advance of migration to avoid delays.</p>
<p><strong>3</strong> Make friends with the network team and make them a part of the planning process. A good working relationship with the networking team will reduce political obstacles and accelerate troubleshooting.</p>
<p><strong>4</strong> Use hardlinking when possible to reduce reliance on network transfers during migration. Backing up a system’s user settings and data (state) on the system being migrated reduces the chance of the network becoming a bottleneck. This is much simpler with unencrypted hard drives, but can work on encrypted drives in some situations.</p>
<p><strong>5</strong> Set accurate user expectations. SCCM asset intelligence can ensure that users don’t lose capabilities. If the migration would cause a user to lose a personal or otherwise non-business-critical application, then it’s important to communicate that even though the change has no impact to the business. It is common to leave off some data, such as a user's "My Pictures" directory and it's important to let the user know early what won't be transferred.</p>

<p>Fraud is a constant danger for companies around the world, with its ability to damage the bottom line, and reputation, of even the most profitable of firms. Far from being an isolated risk, a recent report from J.P. Morgan showed that almost two thirds (61 percent) of companies had experienced attempted or actual payment fraud in 2012. These incidents of fraud can be both internal, with employees leveraging access and understanding of internal processes to steal from the company; and external, with outside individuals or groups trying to obtain sensitive financial or customer data.</p>
<p>As such, companies need to protect themselves by instigating strict internal procedures for financial transactions, as well as locking down access to data from outside sources.</p>
<p><strong>Providing oversight</strong></p>
<p>In the fight against crime, Treasury Management Systems (TMS) can prove invaluable in reinforcing a company’s anti-fraud procedures. For example, once implemented, a TMS can provide an enterprise-wide view of all transactions and bank accounts, while monitoring payments and balances. This is no simple task, when you consider the huge volume of transactions that could be involved; potentially hundreds of thousands per month. By reconciling all actual transactions against forecasts, any anomalies, unusual money movements, or suspicious patterns can be flagged for resolution by the treasury team.</p>
<p>Centralization of monitoring and maintenance of bank accounts via TMS technologies can also enable treasury teams to oversee accounts in multiple countries across a variety of banks, and can help them to comply with local and international regulations. Management of bank account signatories is a good example of how the daunting administrative task of managing access to hundreds or thousands of accounts across the world can be streamlined, with the TMS holding a centralized repository of signatories, mapped to corresponding bank accounts. By ensuring employee-account relationships are severed once an employee leaves the company, the potential for fraud to take place is significantly reduced.</p>
<p><strong>Securing payments</strong></p>
<p>Payments are another crucial area of focus when companies are seeking to reduce fraud, as the implementation of electronic initiation and approval of all payments can drastically reduce opportunities for fraudulent activities. By eliminating paper or email requests for payments, phishing attempts and potentially fraudulent payment requests can be neutered. It then becomes increasingly difficult for outside parties to use publicly available information (such as the names of company representatives and email addresses) to target unstructured payment systems. Managing all payment approvals and initiations via one centralized TMS ensures that all tracking is done through one single system, simplifying and cutting down on work processes. In addition, the introduction of digital signatures, which are held within a TMS and applied to all payments, can help with the speedy and accurate validation of payments.</p>
<p><strong>Restricting access</strong></p>
<p>While it may appear to be an obvious step, locking down access points to ensure only the right people have access to sensitive data is a key stage in reinforcing a company’s defenses against fraud. By implementing stringent access policies such as a requirement for stronger passwords and authentication tools, companies can take an important step towards protecting their data. Recent surveys have shown that 90 percent of passwords are so basic that they can be cracked by hackers, highlighting the pressing need for companies to ensure their employees are choosing sophisticated passwords, and changing them regularly.</p>
<p>Companies should also consider hosting their TMS offsite, to boost security. This is because many companies do not apply strict access policies for their server rooms. In addition, they may not have different access controls in place for their TMS, as opposed to the rest of their servers, despite the heightened sensitivity of the data contained within. By removing physical access to the TMS, and moving it to an externally hosted and protected cloud, treasury teams can reinforce their company’s security, eliminating fraud and maintaining data integrity. Treasury teams should also demand that their SaaS TMS providers meet the most stringent of security protocols -- namely SOC 1 and 2.</p>
<p><strong>Technology to the fore</strong></p>
<p>The implementation of an efficient treasury technology such as a TMS can prove invaluable in helping treasury teams to control access to critical data, extending oversight into all of a company’s transactions and bank accounts and simplifying payments processes. In addition, with the right systems, treasury teams can update procedures quickly and easily, roll out upgrades across the enterprise simultaneously, and keep their organizations one step ahead of those with criminal intentions.</p>

<p>Version 13 remain standalone tools -- allowing users to purchase them outright -- and come with a number of new and improved features to build on previous updates.</p>
<p><span id="more-37931"></span>Photoshop Elements 13 introduces a number of new features. It opens with what Adobe describes as offering "a cool twist on your Facebook page" by making it easy to create two images that blend into each other when used as profile picture and cover photo.</p>
<p>Another new tool is Photomerge Compose, which allows users to create "mashups" of different photos by pulling elements from one and dropping them into another. Photoshop Elements then attempts to blend both color and lighting to create a realistic-looking scene.</p>
<p>Users also gain the ability to nudge selection boundaries to fine-tune object selections, while the program also now offers a choice of suggested compositions when cropping images, as well as displaying five different ways of applying an effect to give users a head-start on choosing their personal favorite.</p>
<p>Photoshop Elements 13’s slideshow feature also gains support for displaying multiple photos on each slide.</p>
<p>The program’s Guided Edit options have also been extended, with new features designed to create hybrid color and black-and-white photos, including one that allows the user to leave a single color in place.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Adobe Premiere Elements 13 adds more video automation tools to its roster. Chief among these is Video Story, a tool that automatically generates movies -- including trims, transitions and music -- from user-selected clips. All the user needs to do is choose a story type and organize the clips into chapters.</p>
<p>Another automated addition allows users to pick favorite moments from a video clip and then Elements will automatically turn them into a movie.</p>
<p>New Guided Edit tools have also been added to Premiere Elements 13, making it easy to add motion effects inside movie titles as well as other effects and blurs designed to draw attention to a specific part of a scene.</p>
<p>The new build also promises improvements to its Shake Stabilizer tool, which is designed to help correct the effects of motion shake.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-160484" src="http://betanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/angry-cellphone-user-600x399.png" alt="angry-cellphone-user" width="600" height="399" /></p>
<p>Apple is now advising its iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus-toting customers to downgrade from iOS 8.0.1, which was only introduced yesterday, because the latest version of its mobile operating system contains some pretty nasty bugs that ruin the user experience.</p>
<p>Apple publicly admits that installing iOS 8.0.1 on iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus may lead to a loss of cellular service and the inability to make use of Touch ID, neither of which plagues iOS 8. The older iteration, which was rolled out on September 17, is not without bugs, however Apple would rather you run into them again over not being able to make calls and use the fingerprint scanner.</p>
<p>"We have a workaround for you if you have an iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus and you lost cellular service and Touch ID functionality today after updating to iOS 8.0.1", <a title="Loss of cellular service or ability to use Touch ID after updating to iOS 8.0.1 on iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus" href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT6487" target="_blank">says</a> Apple on one of its support pages. "You can reinstall iOS 8 through iTunes by following the instructions below".</p>
<p>Apple has also yanked iOS 8.0.1 from its servers, preventing more users from running into the same problems. Considering that it's not out of the question for some people's lives to be at risk from being unable to make and receive calls, that sounds like a logical step.</p>
<p>In case you are wondering what the said instructions are, here is the step-by-step guide Apple provides on how you can downgrade to iOS 8:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Make sure that you're using the <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5654">latest version of iTunes</a>.</li>
<li>Connect your iPhone to iTunes.</li>
<li>Back up your iPhone in iTunes on your Mac or PC. iCloud backups won't restore to earlier versions, including iOS 8.0.</li>
<li>Download the file below that corresponds to your device:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://appldnld.apple.com/iOS8/031-05647.20140917.b0n9s/iPhone7,2_8.0_12A365_Restore.ipsw">iPhone 6</a></li>
<li><a href="http://appldnld.apple.com/iOS8/031-05555.20140917.YWW0v/iPhone7,1_8.0_12A366_Restore.ipsw">iPhone 6 Plus</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Select the file you just downloaded by doing one of these in iTunes:
<ul>
<li>Mac: Press the Option key and click Check for Update.</li>
<li>Windows: Press the Shift key and click Check for Update.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Press Update to install iOS 8 on your iPhone.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Even so, this is still not a terribly great workaround, as Apple says that the Health app will not function after downgrading to iOS 8. The fix is installing iOS 8.0.2, which is set to be released in the next couple of days.</p>
<p>What's more, Apple is apparently also publicly apologizing for iOS 8.0.1, issuing a statement to the <em>Verge</em> in which the company <a title="Apple's fix for major iOS 8 bug coming in the 'next few days'" href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/25/6842487/apple-directing-people-to-reinstall-ios-8-while-it-figures-out-a-fix" target="_blank">says</a>: "We apologize for the great inconvenience experienced by users, and are working around the clock to prepare iOS 8.0.2 with a fix for the issue, and will release it as soon as it is ready in the next few days".</p>
<p>I cannot remember the last time that Apple had to do these things. Maybe some extra testing is in order? I find it hard to believe that this problem couldn't have been spotted by thorough beta testing.</p>
