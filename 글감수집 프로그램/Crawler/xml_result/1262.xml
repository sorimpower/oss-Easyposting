				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Outreach, relationship and community building are vital parts of growing any audience, online or off, for profit or hobby. To evoke any response from visitors to your site or consumers you have to be able to serve, prove trustworthiness and provide value at all stages of a lasting relationship. That is why collaboration is so powerful and social networks, for the most part, have been so successful because their functions rely on what drives human beings to action; building relationships. A majority of the most successful blogs and businesses in the current new media age have one thing in common and that&#8217;s a focus on serving their community while embracing and collaborating with peers to increase the value of their content within their niche. An approach focused solely on self gain won&#8217;t last for the long run since relationships are not built by taking but giving.</p>
<p><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-29901" src="http://www.blogherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/collab-580x295.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="295" /><span></span></p>
<p>Therefore, collaboration is a powerful practice for vastly improving the quality of whatever it is you&#8217;re offering your audience and community. Whether it&#8217;s advice, commentary or products and services. Partnering with the right players in your niche can have an astounding effect on your business as you align yourself with the success of others and through sharing resources, your experiences and opportunities are multiplied.</p>
<p>Evaluate the success of various blogs across the web such as <a href="http://www.socialmediatoday.com" target="_blank">Social Media Today</a>, <a href="http://www.smartpassiveincome.com" target="_blank">Smart Passive Income</a> and <a href="http://www.brainymarketer.com/about-us/" target="_blank">BrainyMarketer</a> (which is fairly new and has grown a great deal in short time span) for example, you&#8217;ll see that community building and collaboration were and still are integral to their success. Through pooling resources with other bloggers, <a href="http://www.blogherald.com/2014/08/21/use-interviews-collaboration-boost-traffic-sales-online/" target="_blank">conducting interviews</a> and communicating directly with their audiences with a real focus on relationships, they have found what works.</p>
<p>As you contemplate on kicking your blog into the next gear, try to identify opportunities to collaborate with other bloggers to create content that better serves your audience. In doing so, here are a few tools that will help you make the most out of your experience for maximum impact.</p>
<h3>ClickMeeting</h3>
<p>Hosting meetings and webinars online are powerful for taking your ideas to an audience separated by geographical boundaries while keeping the experience personal and intimate. Keeping team members engaged and contributing requires that you create a culture of trust and reliance on each other towards achieving common goals and <a href="http://www.clickmeeting.com" target="_blank">ClickMeeting</a> is a premium product that supports this very well.</p>
<p><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29896" src="http://www.blogherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/clickmeeting.png" alt="clickmeeting" width="483" height="378" /></p>
<p>Through features such as audio/video presentations, desktop sharing, recorded meetings and allowing for connections from absolutely any device with an internet connection you&#8217;ll have the tools necessary to build strong long distance relationships and collaborate in an effective and interactive manner.</p>
<h3>Trello</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.trello.com" target="_blank">Trello</a> is a delightful collaboration tool built to bring teams together in the most intuitive and user-friendly manner possible. The app uses a card-based system for keeping your ideas and &#8220;to-do&#8217;s&#8221; as simple and straight-forward as possible. This systems helps users to perfectly visualize all stages of work that needs to be accomplished without digging deep into the details. This means that problems can be solved quicker and work completed faster.</p>
<p><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-29897" src="http://www.blogherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/home-hero-1-580x323.png" alt="home-hero (1)" width="580" height="323" /></p>
<p>It uses a simple drag and drop system which is used to move task / information cards from column to column and people are assigned to each card by dragging their profile picture onto the card.</p>
<p>Also, touted as one of the best mobile and tablet collaboration apps on the market, the mobile experience is smooth, has a easy learning curve and simplifies collaboration where many other tools fail.</p>
<h3>Freedcamp</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.freedcamp.com" target="_blank">Freedcamp</a> is a free, secure and complete collaboration tool built for more than simply assigning tasks. Backed by an open source community, the web app enables you and your collaborators to get things done with a focus on discussions, assigning tasks, adding responsible users, setting timelines and milestones, collecting and reviewing feedback and the ability to create multiple workspaces for an unlimited number of projects.</p>
<p><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-29898" src="http://www.blogherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Issue_Tracker_batch_views-580x292.gif" alt="Issue_Tracker_batch_views" width="580" height="292" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a simple web app that provides a distraction-free experience that not only works for teams but even for the individual blogger with a need to keep work and ideas organized.</p>
<h3>Coggle.it</h3>
<p><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-29895" src="http://www.blogherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/coggleit-580x244.png" alt="coggleit" width="580" height="244" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.coggle.it" target="_blank">Coogle.it</a> is not your average collaboration tool but is a simple yet powerful mind-mapping app to help individuals and teams plan and get complex tasks done cohesively by merging and visualizing itineraries and scope. Coggle.it is amazing for bringing large scale ideas together to help envision how each step, task and stage connects with the mission as a whole. Whether you&#8217;re trying to plan upcoming blog posts, visualize how a year worth of online activities work together or assigning tasks to team members, the app serves well.</p>
<p>The design and features are very intuitive and easy to understand; making planning, collaborating and recording thoughts as seamless as writing on a sheet of paper.</p>
<h3>Evernote</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.evernote.com" target="_blank">Evernote</a> is a note-taking / collaboration tool that can be very useful for the team that deals with a torrent of content. It&#8217;s a curators dream as the app excels at facilitating the collection of all kinds of media via the web browser from websites, your mobile phone&#8217;s image gallery, voice notes, video, and practically any kind of media you can get your hands on via any device.</p>
<p><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-29900" src="http://www.blogherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/evernote_web_new8-580x387.jpg" alt="evernote_web_new8" width="580" height="387" /></p>
<p>Although I don&#8217;t consider Evernote the most powerful collaboration tool, it is particularly useful for large teams of bloggers and other types of content curators who collaborate on large volumes of information. The app facilitates managing large amounts of data with a well designed archiving and document sorting system. Excellent for individuals and large teams of content creators.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Guest blogging, guest posting, or guest writing &#8211; whatever you want to call it &#8211; is still very much alive, in spite of Matt Cutts saying &#8220;<a href="http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2324561/Matt-Cutts-Says-Stop-Guest-Blogging-for-SEO-Heres-Everything-You-Need-to-Know" target="_blank">stop guest blogging for SEO</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/archives/2014/09/25/nurture-guest-writing-network/guest-blog/" rel="attachment wp-att-30938"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-30938" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/guest-blog-585x438.jpg" alt="guest writing network" width="585" height="438" /></a><br />
<a title="guest writing network" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/cameronconner/" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
<p>We definitely agree that guest blogging has its pitfalls, but as Matt Cutts also said, guest blogging per se is not &#8220;bad&#8221;. It gets all sleazy when it&#8217;s done simply for SEO, and when the content and link quality is low.</p>
<p>That being said, <a title="guest blogging not dead" href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/archives/2014/02/24/guest-blogging-dead-matured-new-guide-online-writers/" target="_blank">we&#8217;re all for guest blogging</a>. We accept guest posts, and we also guest post on other blogs. But we totally agree with the concept of NOT doing guest blogging purely for SEO, and we want to ensure that the guest posts we accept are high quality and not (link) spammy.<span id="more-30935"></span></p>
<p>For sure, you see the merits of this way of thinking. The thing is, even if you agree with the idea, your execution is what counts. What is important is that you actually do guest posting right, and not simply wing it.</p>
<p>One way to do this is to establish a guest writing network &#8211; build your contacts, and nurture them. Build relationships and make sure you take care of them. Otherwise, you&#8217;ll just end up ruining your reputation, and probably destroy your guest writing network.</p>
<h2>Tips to help you nurture and grow your guest writing network.</h2>
<h3>Make sure you meet all the guidelines when you send your entry.</h3>
<p>Whether it is the first time you are guest posting for a site, or you are a regular contributor, the &#8220;rule&#8221; is the same: meet all the guidelines as required by the host site. This is especially important when you&#8217;re doing it for the first time, as you want to make the best impression with the goal of perhaps being able to guest post again in the future. Some editors/bloggers may be lax when it comes to this point and give you another chance, but others will just drop you like a hot potato.</p>
<h3>&#8220;Guest&#8221; is the keyword here.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/archives/2014/09/25/nurture-guest-writing-network/house-guest/" rel="attachment wp-att-30939"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-30939" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/house-guest-585x390.jpg" alt="guest writing network" width="585" height="390" /></a><br />
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/criminalintent/" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
<p>I like comparing guest posting to visiting a friend, wherein you are a guest. You stay in their house and behave like a visitor, not as if you owned the house.</p>
<p>With guest posting, remember that you do not own the blog. The blog/site accepting your article <strong>does not owe you anything</strong>. Behave as if you were visiting a friend; be courteous, be polite, take into consideration the fact that you are, for the lack of a better term, asking the host for a favor.</p>
<h4>Also read: <a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/archives/2013/10/23/successful-guest-blogging-how-not-to-sleepwalk-right-into-penalties/#a01by1xGLY3p3HK8.99" target="_blank">Successful Guest Blogging: How Not to Sleepwalk Right into Penalties</a></h4>
<h3>Don&#8217;t be annoying.</h3>
<p>All that being said, don&#8217;t be annoying. There are so many ways a guest blogger can be annoying. Ignoring the first two points above is annoying to the host. Not making edits when the host asks you to make edits is annoying.</p>
<p>Another thing that is annoying is drowning the host with emails about whether they received your email or not, or when your article will get posted. This is not to say that following up is a negative thing. Do give the host time to respond, however. Often, blogs that accept guest posts indicate a &#8220;waiting period&#8221; &#8211; the time they need to respond. This can be anywhere from 24 hours to a week. First, check if the blog explicitly gives a waiting period. If so, then don&#8217;t email till that waiting period has expired.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/archives/2014/09/25/nurture-guest-writing-network/clock-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-30940"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-30940" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/clock-585x390.jpg" alt="guest writing network" width="585" height="390" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/bigpresh/" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
<p>If there is no waiting period indicated, wait a couple of days before following up. If it&#8217;s the weekend, don&#8217;t bug the host either. While most bloggers check their email in the weekend and maybe even work, not everyone appreciates being bugged over the weekend.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Finding a trustworthy site with high quality content to work with on a regular basis is not always an easy thing. When you do find a site that regularly accepts your posts, make sure it stays in your guest writing network by following the tips above.</p>
<p><strong>Back to you: how do you make sure you are nurturing your guest writing network?</strong></p>

<p class="p2">The excitement of dreaming about an exotic trip or returning home from a global excursion is even more fun when shared. You may be ecstatic to share your travel inspiration and adventures in a blog, but building the space is the first step. The following five tips can help any vagabond start a travel blogging journey.<span id="more-30928"></span></p>
<p class="p3"><b>Find a Host</b></p>
<p class="p2">Regardless of whether you want to create a travel blog to update your friends and family while abroad or if you want to try to earn money from your blog, the first step is to <a href="http://www.bluehost.com/" target="_blank"><span class="s1">find a host</span></a>.</p>
<p class="p2">Adventurous Kate, a full-time solo traveler who quit her job at age 26 to see the world, suggests that everyone—no matter their experience level or intentions—go with Bluehost. They offer a low price of $6.95 for 12 months, and the company’s friendly and knowledgeable customer service team is always reachable if and when there’s an issue. As a bonus, the company offers a free domain name for your new travel blog. Compared to a free WordPress blog for example, a blog with a domain name and hosting provider is more searchable and has better opportunity for monetization.</p>
<p class="p2">Once you secure hosting, <a title="aspiring travel bloggers" href="http://www.adventurouskate.com/how-to-start-a-travel-blog/" target="_blank"><span class="s1">check out Adventurous Kate&#8217;s tips for setting up your blog</span></a>, including WordPress and Plugin installations, as well as securing social media handles, starting an email list and joining Travel Blog Success, a traveling online course and community.</p>

<p class="p3"><b>Find Your Brand</b></p>
<p class="p2">Do It While Your Young, a website dedicated to inspiring travel for ambitious women, suggests that you <a title="aspiring travel bloggers" href="http://diwyy.com/how-to-start-a-travel-blog-part-one/" target="_blank"><span class="s1">come up with a specific angle</span></a> to brand your blog and give it a unique voice. If you adore a certain part of the world—for example, Hawaii, the Southwest or Europe—focus your travel blog on that region to narrow down its theme. If traveling by an RV is your passion, center the blog on traveling tips and ideas for visiting destinations in your four-wheeled home. <a title="aspiring travel bloggers" href="http://www.arestlesstransplant.com/" target="_blank"><span class="s1">A Restless Transplant</span></a> documents indie life on the road as vagabond Foster Huntington and his gang move from state to state in his camper van.</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/archives/2014/09/22/blog-adventures-5-tips-aspiring-travel-bloggers/a-restless-transplant/" rel="attachment wp-att-30930"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-30930" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/A-Restless-Transplant-585x319.png" alt="aspiring travel bloggers" width="585" height="319" /></a></p>
<p class="p2">Blogger Nomadic Matt has also created a name for himself by offering proven tactics and advice for budget travel. Nomadic Matt took his first trip overseas to Costa Rica as a two-week vacation from his first job. His next life-changing trip was a Thailand trip where he met five backpackers who inspired him to liberate himself from his job and travel for less. He&#8217;s positioned his blog to be an excellent travel resource offering advice like<a title="aspiring travel bloggers" href="http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/emily-success-story/" target="_blank"><span class="s1"> teaching English to fund world travels</span></a> and how to find cheap flights.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Find Your Catch Phrase</b></p>
<p class="p2">In order to emphasize your brand, create a logo or saying to help establish the theme or essence of your blog. Even if you start your blog for friends and family, like-minded people will probably find it and follow you. By adding an easily-recognizable logo or catch phrase, you will help your site stand out in people&#8217;s minds, increasing the likelihood that they will return again.</p>
<p class="p2">The tagline of <a href="http://www.pret-a-voyager.com/" target="_blank"><span class="s1">travel blog Prêt À Voyager</span></a>, &#8220;travel is not about where you go, but how you see the world&#8221; shapes the idea that traveling isn&#8217;t always about arriving at new destinations and visiting faraway locations. Traveling is about trying new things, embarking on new experiences and connecting with other creatives across the globe, even if you never leave a city. Although Prêt À Voyager&#8217;s Anne Stark Ditmeyer is indeed a seasoned worldly traveler, she uses her blog as a creative outlet for how she continues to discover and re-discover her beloved home Paris.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Find Your Camera Angle</b></p>
<p class="p2">A lot of travel blogs feature long, flowery descriptions of various sights around the world. But you might not have the time or inclination to fill your own blog with a lot of writing. Travel blog visitors love visuals—lots of short videos and photos, suggests Budget Travel.</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/archives/2014/09/22/blog-adventures-5-tips-aspiring-travel-bloggers/classe/" rel="attachment wp-att-30931"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-30931" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Classe-585x271.png" alt="aspiring travel  bloggers" width="585" height="271" /></a></p>
<p class="p2">Travel website Fathom Away, an online destination for &#8220;inspiring stories, practical advice, and useful tools and products,&#8221; features Tiny Atlas Quarterly as one of the best travel blogs and websites. Tiny Atlas Quarterly is a talented roster of photographers who capture the beauty of a locale and pass on travel narratives through <a href="http://tinyatlasquarterly.com/" target="_blank"><span class="s1">dynamic images and beautiful portraits</span></a>. Classe Touriste also uses imagery to inspire and celebrate travel with its<a title="aspiring travel bloggers" href="http://one.classetouriste.be/" target="_blank"><span class="s1"> one day one photoblog</span></a> saturated with pictures and on-the-go life snippets from blogger Debbie Pappyn&#8217;s around-the-world adventures.</p>

<p class="p3"><b>Find the Cloud</b></p>
<p class="p2">Is your blog consumed with photos and videos? Secure your content and <a href="http://www.top10cloudstorage.com/review/livedrive/" target="_blank"><span class="s1">find a good cloud storage company</span></a> to safely store all of your vacation shots and any other blog-related work you have collected along the way. If you&#8217;re unsure about where to look, a website like Top10CloudStorage is a great place to start. The cloud storage, online backup and Web hosting resource offers helpful reviews and information about cloud storage companies. LiveDrive is an excellent feature for backing up content and seamlessly transferring files across devices and to social media platforms.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><a href="http://solotravelerblog.com/travel-technology-cloud-technology/" target="_blank">Solo Traveler</a></span> features guest blogger and tech guru Doug from ihelpinnovate.com who recommends that travelers use the cloud as a virtual storage center for important files and precious photos while traveling. Documents, files and photos are securely stored in the cloud and accessed by smartphones, laptops or tablets via the Internet. No matter where you are in the world, the cloud backs up data in case of a disaster. Then, once you return home, you can easily access your files and pictures and upload these snap shots to share on your blog.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: This post was written by Shah, a professional writer and blogger interested in writing about various aspect of SEO, marketing, tech, and design. You can join Shah at <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+NayabSh/posts" target="_blank"><span class="s1">Google+</span></a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/Designermagorg" target="_blank">T<span class="s1">witter</span></a>.</em></p>
<p>Once a website has been created, webmasters have to figure out how to get their rankings increased in search engines. Top rankings ensure more visibility and enhanced earnings. <a href="https://www.xing.com/profile/Brent_Franson2" target="_blank">Brent Franson</a> offers five surefire tips that will lead to search engine domination.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/unique-writing.png"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-30916" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/unique-writing-585x298.png" alt="good search engine ranking" width="585" height="298" /></a></p>
<p><strong> Create Unique Content to Stop Penalties</strong></p>
<p>Back in the day, people could get away with submitting the same exact article content to multiple directories. Google has put a stop to this and will flag websites that have the same article in multiple places linking back to them. To ensure that sites are never flagged, it is advisable to submit a unique article to each directory. Even if the articles are on the same topic, they all must be 100 percent unique. It’s true that it will take time to produce unique content for every site but it would have a positive long impact over website ranking. So invest your time to produce quality content and see the results. <span id="more-30915"></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Also read: How to Reshare Old Content Without Annoying Your Followers</h4>
<p><strong>Do Not Keyword Stuff, Write for Humans</strong></p>
<p>Google wants content that is not only readable by computers. The company also wants humans to be able to read it comfortably and become engaged. When keywords are not stuffed but worked into the content to read naturally, Google and other search engine reward these webmasters by moving their ranking higher. A three to five percent keyword density is recommended. If an article is 300 words long, then someone using a three percent keyword density will want each keyword to appear nine times in the content. Keeping this simple calculation in mind will help you avoid keyword stuffing issues.</p>
<p><strong>Choose Only Top Content Submission Directories</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/top-article-submission-directories.gif"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30917" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/top-article-submission-directories.gif" alt="good search engine ranking" width="469" height="374" /></a><br />
In order to have the most success, article content must only be submitted to the <a title="good search engine ranking" href="http://seobuzzworld.com/top-5-seo-directories-to-ensure-higher-ranking-of-your-website/" target="_blank">top SEO directories</a>. Some of these directories are niche-specific while others will allow submissions on any subject. Ezinearticles.com, Squidoo.com, Goarticles.com and <a href="http://www.articlesbase.com" target="_blank">articlesbase.com</a> are examples of high-ranking directories open to receiving content on all subjects. Because the traffic to these directories is magnificent, views on article content and websites are a guarantee.</p>
<p><strong>Produce Content Often</strong></p>
<p>In order to maintain a spot in the search engines, it is vital to produce content often. It is recommended that 20 unique articles be produced on a weekly basis. These articles can all be submitted to different directories or to a handful of favorite ones. Creating content regularly will keep readers coming back for more because they will look forward to something new to read, and they will also be inclined to check the website to see if there is anything new being offered.</p>
<p><strong>Stay up to Date with SEO Trends</strong></p>
<p>What worked last year may not work this year. <a href="http://www.searchenginepeople.com/blog/925-seo-in-2014.html" target="_blank">SEO trends are ever changing</a>. To keep up to date with current SEO trends, it is critical to subscribe to the RSS feed of a professional SEO blog. There are also email lists that are dedicated to providing nuggets of precious knowledge to business owners, and they can be subscribed to just by visiting the <a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/archives/2014/03/06/search-engine-optimisation-shift-engaging-content/" target="_blank">websites of SEO professionals</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to following these five tips, webmasters also need to make certain their websites are search engine friendly. Clean code must be used to build the website so the search engine spiders could crawl it easily. Additionally, keywords need to be used evenly throughout the content on the web pages, such as in page titles, additional headings and in the content body. If these tips are followed and the website is designed to make optimization effortless, there will be no trouble dominating the search engines. After some time, a first page ranking can be achieved and profits will soar tremendously.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media has become the de facto venue for people to express themselves online. While it used to be that personal blogging was where friends and friends of friends would go to find out what was going on in other people&#8217;s lives, now it&#8217;s platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+ (no it&#8217;s not a ghost town), and Tumblr where you will find people from all walks of lives.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/social-media.png"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-30922" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/social-media-585x321.png" alt="social media is changing your brain" width="585" height="321" /></a></p>
<p>More than a personal communication or expression tool, <a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/archives/2014/09/15/social-media-monitoring-vital-companies-asia-pacific/" target="_blank">social media is being used by brands</a> &#8211; corporate or personal &#8211; to expand their reach and interact with their target audience. Big brands like Coca-Cola, Oreo, Nike, and KFC are known to be on the ball when it comes to their social media accounts. Celebrities are not exempt, too. Just think of Rihanna, Justin Bieber (yeah, sorry if I&#8217;ve offended anyone just by mentioning him), William Shatner, and so many more. Then there are the athletes, influencers in the tech scene, influencers in the marketing scene, and so on.<span id="more-30921"></span></p>
<p>Everyone, it seems, is on social media &#8211; from your brother in middle school to your grandmother.</p>
<p>But did you know that social media has an impact your brain? In fact, social media is changing your brain. Right now. Even as you read this post.</p>
<p>The guys as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC552Sd-3nyi_tk2BudLUzA" target="_blank">AsapSCIENCE</a> have created an explainer video showing how social media is changing your brain as you continue to use whichever platforms you prefer. It tackles concepts such as emotions, attention, and decision making &#8211; all of which have some relation to how our brains function.</p>
<p>Take a look at the video and find out how social media is changing your brain, and then decide whether or not you have to change some of your habits.</p>

<p>With the right tools, you can accomplish lots of stuff in no time: monitoring your niche, automating tweets, posting at best times of the day, authenticating via social networks, displaying selected tweets on your blog, etc.<span id="more-30901"></span></p>
<p>Actually, the amount of Twitter-related tools that you can use today might seem overwhelming <em>(especially if you&#8217;re a <a href="http://bloggerjet.com/twitter-marketing-for-dummies/" target="_blank">Twitter Marketing dummy</a>)</em>, so to save some of your precious time we&#8217;d like to suggest you a list of only 10 Twitter tools that truly deserve your attention.</p>
<p><strong>1. <a title="twitter tools" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/minimalist-twitter-widget/" target="_blank">Minimalist Twitter Widget</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/01-minimalist-twitter-widget.jpg"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-30903" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/01-minimalist-twitter-widget-585x190.jpg" alt="twitter tools" width="585" height="190" /></a></p>
<p>If you’re searching for a widget that displays tweets on your sidebar without a lot of flash, this is the one that you want. It definitely falls under the less is more idea and it’s hard to tell that it’s actually for Twitter.</p>
<p><strong>2. <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/nextend-twitter-connect/" target="_blank">Nextend Twitter Connect</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/02-nextend-twitter-connect.jpg"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-30904" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/02-nextend-twitter-connect-585x189.jpg" alt="02-nextend-twitter-connect" width="585" height="189" /></a></p>
<p>This is a great plugin for those who have a lot of followers. This plugin can be put on your website to allow people to login your site using their account with Twitter.</p>
<p><strong>3. <a title="twitter tools" href="http://www.tweetdis.com/" target="_blank">TweetDis</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/03-tweetdis.jpg"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-30905" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/03-tweetdis-585x189.jpg" alt="03-tweetdis" width="585" height="189" /></a></p>
<p>Do you love writing content and you want to make it easier for people to tweet your content? Well, with TweetDis it’s simple. This WordPress plugin lets you turn any writing passage into one that can be tweeted. Your reader only has to click on it once so that it can be easily tweeted. The result is a professional looking tweet that engages readers and encourages them to visit!</p>
<p><strong>4. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/random-tweet-widget/" target="_blank">Random Tweet</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/04-random-tweet-widget.jpg"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-30906" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/04-random-tweet-widget-585x190.jpg" alt="04-random-tweet-widget" width="585" height="190" /></a></p>
<p>Just because your tweets are old, it doesn’t mean they don’t need some love, too. This widget allows you to preselect a certain amount of tweets in your sidebar and then it will rotate them. This will ensure that your visitors are able to see both your new and old tweets.</p>
<p><strong>5. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/rotatingtweets/" target="_blank">Rotating Tweets</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/05-rotating-tweets.jpg"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-30907" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/05-rotating-tweets-585x157.jpg" alt="twitter tools" width="585" height="157" /></a></p>
<p>Want people to have the latest news from your Twitter account? Or maybe you want to encourage everyone to go and look at your account? This is a very basic widget but it lets you display your latest retweets, tweets, and it also includes a button so that visitors can follow you too.</p>
<p><strong>6. <a title="twitter tools" href="http://jetpack.me/" target="_blank">JetPack</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/06-jetpack.jpg"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-30908" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/06-jetpack-585x189.jpg" alt="06-jetpack" width="585" height="189" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/08-twitter-hover-tweet.jpg"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-30910" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/08-twitter-hover-tweet-585x189.jpg" alt="08-twitter-hover-tweet" width="585" height="189" /></a></p>

<p>If you feel as if you can’t get enough time on Twitter, this plugin will be a lifesaver. It lets you tweet your posts automatically, tweet right when you’re on your blog, and archive your tweets into an area so that your audience can view.</p>
<p>These Twitter tools absolutely deserve your attention, and we advise you to try them on your own website. However, it has been said numerous times that nothing beats real communication on Twitter.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget that your Twitter followers are humans and they are looking for communication with other humans, not just automated responses. So make sure your Twitter <a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/archives/2014/03/04/integrated-marketing-navigating-murky-waters-modern-media/" target="_blank">Marketing</a> is a mix of both: tools and natural communication.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: This post was written by Elizabeth Victor, Brand Advisor for <a href="http://www.isentia.co.id/" target="_blank">iSentia Media Monitoring</a>. She enjoys sharing tips on social media monitoring and analysis, especially in Asia Pacific. You can find her on <a href="http://plus.google.com/108854409477821637015/" target="_blank">G+</a> and Twitter.</em></p>
<p>Social media monitoring is important for every business in order to keep tabs on what people are saying about your company; however, it is especially important for Asia-Pacific companies who are very conscious about their brand image. Many Asia-Pacific countries are gun shy when it comes to launching social media campaigns for fear of negativity from customers in addition to abiding by strict guidelines and laws imposed by different countries.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/archives/2014/09/15/social-media-monitoring-vital-companies-asia-pacific/apac-social-media-map/" rel="attachment wp-att-30887"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-30887" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/APAC-Social-Media-Map-585x677.jpg" alt="social media monitoring" width="585" height="677" /></a></p>
<p>Companies like this who are concerned about what people are saying about their brand online should absolutely be using the tools available to monitor online activity. This allows them to venture into social media marketing, where there might not be as much competition present and still keep close tabs on their brand reputation and image.</p>
<p>As experts in social media monitoring, reporting, and creating connections with key influencers, we understand how important company image is for companies in Asia-Pacific companies including Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, and China. For as important as social media monitoring can be to companies, it can be incredibly easy, automated, and even free.<span id="more-30886"></span></p>
<p><strong>Benefits of Social Media Monitoring</strong></p>
<p>Even if you have not established your own social channels, consumers, customers, and employees will be talking about your company and your brand online and in social media. Monitoring these channels allows you to not only know what people are saying, but also react to it.</p>
<p>Setting up your own channels, website, and blog allows you to control the conversation and lay the groundwork online for the types of information that you want current and potential customers to read about you. <a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/archives/2010/08/05/5-free-social-media-icon-sources-for-niche-blogs/" target="_blank">Social media</a> monitoring tells you when, why and how to get in on the conversation. Beyond just listening to what people are saying about your company, you should actively engage with the people that are talking about you. Finding tools that are easy to use and geared towards your specific market are also vital to ensuring a well-executed media monitoring effort.</p>
<p><strong>Social Monitoring Tools</strong></p>
<p>The next step is known how to listen and discern all of the social chatter online. There are quite a few different tools available that will monitor online activity on certain keywords and even people. Once you set them up, automated information can be sent to your email or your mobile device to ensure immediate alerts and allow for a quick response. Some tools even go beyond just social media and can also alert you activity on your competitor’s websites or blogs. Here are a few free tools to consider using:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ifttt.com/" target="_blank"><strong>IFTTT</strong></a> stands for If This Then That. On this website, you can make “recipe” combinations that will alert you to different things. There are far reaching capabilities of this tool in addition to social media monitoring. It allows you to set up an RSS feed that scans industry websites you want to keep a close eye on via the feed URL function and have the alerts emailed to you.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/settings/me" target="_blank"><strong>Me on the Web</strong></a> is a free service offered by Google that allows you to search for your own name, but also any other person or keyword and instantly get Google’s results. Google Alerts is the way to automate this feature. You can set up alerts for any keyword or key phrase to be emailed to you. You can also set the frequency as often as you want.</li>
<li><a href="http://IceRocket.com" target="_blank"><strong>IceRocket</strong></a> is free and allows you to instantly search social sites for mentions of keywords, phrases, or names you are interested in monitoring. It will search blogs, Twitter, and Facebook. There is a wide range of filtering options of the results so you can narrow down the information you are looking for to very specific parameters.</li>
<li><a href="http://Topsy.com" target="_blank"><strong>Topsy</strong></a> is a very powerful Twitter search tool. This free tool goes beyond Twitter’s search feature and helps you find key influencers in your industry. Identifying influencers not only allows you to see what they are saying but also opens to door to connecting with them to see if they are willing to talk about or review your product or service.</li>
<li><a href="http://SocialMention.com" target="_blank"><strong>Social Mention </strong></a> is another tool that helps identify sentiment in social media mentions about your company online on websites as well as social sites. Searches on SocialMention.com are done in real-time and they include sentiment, top keywords, top users, top hashtags, and last mention.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion and Takeaways for Your Business</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/archives/2014/09/15/social-media-monitoring-vital-companies-asia-pacific/influencepoints/" rel="attachment wp-att-30888"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-30888" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/influencepoints-585x347.png" alt="social media monitoring" width="585" height="347" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/archives/2012/02/07/how-to-destroy-your-blog-with-bad-social-media-engagement-practices/" target="_blank">Monitoring social media</a> is important all over the world, however it is vital in certain cultures where company image is important and social media is still growing. Different tools are available for different countries. Finding a social monitoring tool that is most compatible with the culture and laws governing your country will make the process easier for your company.</p>
<p>Once you have a media monitoring campaign set up, there are some universal guidelines to go live by.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ignoring social media comments (whether they are bad or good) is never a good idea. Interacting and further engaging consumers are the best ways to keep the conversation going, fix any problems as they arise, and create a positive social image for your brand.</li>
<li>Even if the comments from customers are negative, a quick response and apology shows not just the person posting the complaint but anyone else reading that your company cares and takes the time to address and fix any issues.</li>
<li>When you are dealing with a particular customer problem on social media, the best thing is to address the issue and take the complaint offline to a more private phone call or email situation instead of listing details right on the social network.</li>
<li>Reacting quickly and professionally should always govern your interactions. Do not let emotions or anger guide your reaction. Follow customer service best practices on social media just as if you are speaking with a customer or client in person.</li>
<li>Never ignore a social media problem assuming that it will just “go away”.</li>
<li>Do not assume that social media does not correlate to sales. A recent study showed that 69 percent of consumers are more likely to patronize a business if they can find them on social media. Therefore, your social media presence not only allows you to monitor and control the conversations about your company, but can increase sales and creates a forum of trust where you can connect with your target audience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you familiarize yourself with the tools that are available to monitor online and media mentions about your business, you will see that you can fully take advantage of growing social media campaign in a market where there is very likely to be less competition. Develop your plan of action and detail a social media and media monitoring strategy. Let your competitors fall into the fears of social media while you succeed and surpass them in reputation and sales as a result.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may be bloggers, content providers, writers, or whatever you want to call yourself, but at the end of the day, we are also consumers. If you think about it, when we&#8217;re not writing, we&#8217;re reading. Or playing games, in some cases. <img src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Couch.jpg"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-30882" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Couch-585x390.jpg" alt="WP Couch Mode" width="585" height="390" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/yodelanecdotal/" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
<p>Some that reading time may be because we want to be at the top of our game when it comes to the niche we write about. Some of the time may be reading for the simple pleasure of reading.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, it cannot be denied that reading is an inherent part of the Internet experience. And that&#8217;s where the highlighting of content comes into the picture.<span id="more-30879"></span></p>
<p>For many people, they just want to see the content of the article or blog post. They want to see the text, the words, and perhaps the accompanying images.</p>
<p><strong>Distraction-free reading.</strong></p>
<p>That&#8217;s why posts like <a href="https://medium.com/everything-about-startups-and-entrepreneurship/how-quitting-my-corporate-job-for-my-startup-dream-f-cked-my-life-up-3b6b3e29b318" target="_blank">this</a> on Medium appeal to readers. The content is the focus of the post, and while photos break up the text, there is flow that still highlights what is to be read without distraction.</p>
<p>Understandably, however, <a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/archives/2014/05/19/networking-for-wordpress-website-business/" target="_blank">some sites need to have ads</a> and other elements that may distract the reader from the content.</p>
<p>What can you do to balance these needs out?</p>
<p>Enter the WP Couch Mode Plugin.</p>
<p>This plugin gives the reader the option to forego all the ads and other distracting elements that may be found in your site. What it does, basically, is to add a link &#8211; which is customizable &#8211; to content. When this link is clicked, a lightbox pops up, showing only the content.</p>
<p>Developer Ritesh Vatwani has incorporated several options, as seen in the screenshot below.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/WPCouchModeSettings.png"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-30880" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/WPCouchModeSettings-585x485.png" alt="WP Couch Mode" width="585" height="485" /></a></p>
<p>When the reader chooses &#8220;Read Mode&#8221;, this is what he will see.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Read-Mode.png"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-30881" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Read-Mode-585x281.png" alt="WP Couch Mode" width="585" height="281" /></a></p>
<p>Obviously, that distraction-free mode is more appealing to readers. Unless you&#8217;re one to actively seek ads for some reason.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finding the perfect formula for driving sales, subscriptions and readers to your website who actually engage is a task that grows more difficult as the web continues to develop and grow. It&#8217;s quite easy to hit a plateau whether you&#8217;re trying to create fresh and appealing content for your personal or corporate blog; or creating a new angle that will attract buyers to your new product or startup. Successful online business is hard work and in reality it&#8217;s not for everyone. The defining quality that is proven to set winners apart from losers simply boils down to persistence.</p>
<p><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30877" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/shutterstock_163307801.jpg" alt="shutterstock_163307801" width="580" height="351" /></p>
<p>The ability to launch winning traffic generation and business booming strategies does not necessarily require that you master every skill possible but more relies on you knowing your target audience&#8217;s needs and being honest with what you can and are willing to provide. A blog that covers social media marketing for instances, does not necessarily need to publish on every possible topic under it&#8217;s umbrella but should narrow the focus to where the impact is greatest based on the marketer&#8217;s skillset and targets for ROI. Especially in cases where a small business or blog is managed by one individual, the stakes are higher regarding using marketing time wisely for maximum effect.<span id="more-30870"></span></p>
<p>So, what are some oftentimes ignored and underutilized techniques that can create success online for marketers and how do you <a href="http://www.smartinsights.com/content-management/content-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank">enrich your content marketing efforts</a> for greater ROI?</p>
<h3>Narrowing Your Focus</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it, there&#8217;s a strong possibility that what you&#8217;re publishing on your blog has already been said and dissected somewhere on the web by a few other bloggers. It&#8217;s extremely difficult to be unique when content is being produced across the world at its current rapid pace. How do you create a unique voice for your brand and standout in the noisy crowd? The best strategy you can employ here is drilling down on your niche topics and narrowing and deepening your focus to go a step further with the general topics being discussed frequently on the web.</p>
<p>There are 3 benefits here:</p>
<p><strong>1) You become an expert in a rarely discussed field</strong> &#8211; Many websites typically discuss the obvious facts and do not dive deep into the &#8220;how&#8217;s&#8221;, &#8220;why&#8217;s&#8221; and &#8220;if&#8217;s&#8221; of the industry. For example, Google launches a new product with &#8220;x&#8221; cool features. Everybody talks about that; you should then dive into commentary on the potential impact on users, use the service and offer detailed reviews and simply look for opportunities to provide and focus on various angles that aren&#8217;t evidently addressed. That&#8217;s how you create unique share-worthy and link-worthy content.</p>
<p><strong>2) Benefit from valuable long tail keywords and niches</strong> &#8211; SEO is alive, will always be alive and you still can win. There is great value in <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2013/08/12/how-to-increase-your-sales-through-long-tail-seo/" target="_blank">long tail keywords</a>. For example, you simply cannot compete with general, broad keywords like &#8220;social media marketing&#8221; or &#8220;increase sales.&#8221; However, you may discover greater opportunities and value for something more narrow like &#8220;how to increase sales without a zero budget&#8221; or &#8220;creating a social media marketing plan for small businesses.&#8221; The keyword competition will be less. Use a tool like <a href="http://keywordtool.io/" target="_blank">Keywordtool.io</a> to discover ideas for narrowing your keyword focus.</p>
<p><strong>3) You save time and energy</strong> &#8211; Focus means that you strip your days of unnecessary work on things that do not add value to your bottom line and objectives.</p>
<h3>Engage Your Target Audience Off Your Website</h3>
<p>Promoting your website and getting feedback from readers and users is not all about you and your site. Advertising your latest blog post on <img style=' float: right; padding: 4px; margin: 0 0 2px 7px;'  class="alignright wp-image-30873 size-medium" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/pitching-280x175.jpg" alt="pitching" width="280" height="175" />Twitter each chance you get will not attract meaningful traffic and engagement unless you&#8217;ve already built a reputation through relationships on social networks. Simply put, people won&#8217;t be interested in your stuff if they have no idea who you are or what you stand for. Sure, you&#8217;ll get a few clicks from readers here and there but the results are negligible.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re trying to get influencers to engage and share your content you&#8217;ll need to engage them as fellow human beings without strictly pitching to them. A recent study by Buzzstream reveals that <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/buzzstream/500-writers-editors-reveal-what-they-look-for-in-a-pitch" target="_blank">64% of writers and editors of popular websites think it&#8217;s important to establish a personal relationship before pitching a story to them</a>.</p>
<p>Treat your target audience as a community and start interacting and building relationships on social media as well as taking advantage of meeting people offline. Share interests and add value to their daily lives by contributing things that they&#8217;ll find useful. Pitching is not your priority here. If an influencer knows that you always add value and always engaged with them on a human level, your profile, work and content will have more value in their eyes. Use tools like <a href="http://commun.it/" target="_blank">Commun.it</a>, <a href="http://hootsuite.com" target="_blank">Hootsuite</a> and <a href="http://oktopost.com" target="_blank">Oktopost</a> to effectively manage your social network relationships.</p>
<p>Build the relationships and you&#8217;ll find that you&#8217;ll achieve higher clickthrough rates on social media and engagement from the readers you acquire.</p>
<h3>Evoke Curiosity</h3>
<p>For whatever reasons visitors are coming to your site you should try to have something that directly addresses that. For example, if your website is directed at teaching readers how to play a musical instrument, you could collect emails from subscribers who would be highly engaged with what you have to offer; like a pop-up that says &#8220;Do you want to learn how to play the piano like Beethoven?&#8221; or something else the average aspiring student can relate to.</p>
<p>Therefore, how you present your content is very important and your wording should address a need the reader may have leading them to explore further. <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/10-sure-fire-headline-formulas-that-work/" target="_blank">Writing a strong headline</a> is an art worth perfecting.</p>
<h3>Optimize Your Site&#8217;s Usability</h3>
<p>Usability is something you should never take for granted. The more enjoyable and user-friendly the experience is for your readers the greater the chance of them spending more time to consume and use your content. They&#8217;ll keep coming back for more.</p>
<p>Make your readers&#8217; experiences better with simple strategies like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making key information easier to find</li>
<li>Keeping relevant info above the fold</li>
<li><a title="5 Ways You Can Speed Up Your Website" href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/archives/2014/09/10/5-ways-you-can-speed-up-your-website/" target="_blank">Optimizing site load speed</a></li>
<li>Eliminating dead-end pages that link to nowhere else on your site</li>
</ul>
<p><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-30875" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/websiteusability-585x402.jpg" alt="websiteusability" width="585" height="402" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2014/08/08/8-ways-to-improve-the-usability-of-your-website/" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://blog.crazyegg.com/2013/08/08/web-usability-tools/" target="_blank">list of free usability testing tools</a> to help assess your site and determine what improvements you can make.</p>
<p>To conclude, increasing engagement relies heavily on your ability to communicate solutions effectively to your target audience with the help of a few tools. While also narrowing your vision to help produce unique products and content users will love and share.</p>

<p>Every blogger faces the challenge of trying to make money out of their passion. At the same time, there are online retailers who just can&#8217;t quite seem to find the best distribution channels for their products.</p>
<p>Affiliate programs or referral links are some of the best ways of getting revenue to your blog, according to many of the most successful bloggers.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Cirqle2-www.cirqle.nl_.jpg"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-30864" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Cirqle2-www.cirqle.nl_-585x462.jpg" alt="multiple affiliate accounts" width="585" height="462" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/archives/2011/11/16/5-business-models-that-suck-less-than-advertising/#more-23727" target="_blank">Referral links are sometimes controversial</a> because visitors feel that they are tricked into using them or that bloggers tint their reviews differently based on whether or not they can earn money from referrals.<span id="more-30863"></span></p>
<p>However, if you do them right, namely disclosing them directly or using them in a way that makes it clear, they can be a good source of revenue.</p>
<p>A new advertising platform has been launched that seeks to change the way bloggers and publications monetize and approach online retail by making it easier to to connect to more affiliates through a single algorithm.</p>
<p>Founded by Dutch startup pioneer, Steven Lammertink, <a href="http://www.cirqle.nl/" target="_blank">Cirqle</a> is a new platform that enables bloggers to connect their content with thousands of popular brand name products while earning revenue on every sale inspired.</p>
<p><em>“Anytime you recommend a relevant product or service to your audience, check to see if they have an affiliate program. If so, sign up and use your affiliate link,</em>” says David Risely of the <a href="http://www.blogmarketingacademy.com/top-10-blog-monetization-strategies-ranked/" target="_blank">Blog Marketing Academy.</a></p>
<p><em>“The idea for Cirqle came when we saw that bloggers, many with very large audiences, were having challenges with monetization. At the same time online retailers were not finding the distribution channels they were looking for. Cirqle was designed from the start to solve both of these problems. This is a market that has not yet actualized, and our goal is to create it out of nothing,</em>” says CEO Steven Lammertink.</p>
<p>According to Kevin Muldoon of <a href="http://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/resources/how-to-monetize-your-blog" target="_blank">Elegant Themes Blog</a>, one of the best ways to earn money through blogging is to use an affiliate program that pays commissions on generated sales.</p>
<p><em>“For one of my old blogs, affiliate income represented around 75% of my total income,</em>” says Muldoon.</p>
<p>A platform like the Dutch startup makes room for commissions to be paid to the blogger without having to setup multiple accounts with different companies. This can be profitable to not only both the author and the retailer, but readers can benefit as well because they are already viewing content that interests them.</p>
<p>Author of “<a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/us/small-business/openforum/articles/4-easy-ways-to-monetize-your-blog/" target="_blank">4 Easy Ways to Monetize Your Blog</a>,” Elaine Pofeldt, says that affiliate programs “<em>will reward you for driving traffic to a particular marketplace by giving you a percentage of the money made from each sale. The trouble is that it can be time consuming to set up each account.”</em></p>
<p>The Cirqle platform was designed to speed up that process through its algorithm that connects to thousands of different brand accounts through a single application.</p>
<p>As suggested by the <a href="http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2011/06/02/five-ways-monetize-wordpress-blog">WordStream Blog</a>, “<em>Many people have trouble with affiliate links because it’s a lot harder than it sounds. Getting sales from affiliate link clicks involves some knowledge of affiliate marketing. If you don’t know the proper way to promote your affiliate links, you’ll end up frustrated from lack of sales and will probably end up pushing away many of your visitors.</em>”</p>
<p>To eliminate this type of frustration, using one platform to handle all marketing strategies seems like a sure way to go.</p>
<p>With a program that would eliminate the need for setting up multiple affiliate accounts, like Cirqle’s, bloggers wouldn’t need to spend as much effort and will be able to focus on revenue for their blogs, as well as focus more on sharing their passion for creating quality content.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Regardless of how you&#8217;ve started publishing online, whether it&#8217;s from a childhood passion, hobby or as a result of an experiment, the topic of monetization will always come up; and although it may not be your primary motivation, it&#8217;s still worth paying attention and trying something new.</p>
<p><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-30835" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/making-money-online-585x327.jpg" alt="making money online" width="585" height="327" /></p>
<p>There are many success stories from bloggers who have made hundreds of thousands of dollars almost by accident as they were blinded by their focused obsession with their topic and didn&#8217;t care about making money but ended up doing so anyway. Unfortunately, the majority of writers are not that lucky and need to employ a disciplined approach to delivering quality that their audiences will enjoy. Yet, quality on it&#8217;s own is no guarantee for monetary success.<span id="more-30830"></span></p>
<p>As you focus on hitting your monetary targets with your website and online business, you will find the greatest long-term success when your audiences&#8217; needs are best met; putting them first. Monetization can be easily incorporated once you have a satisfied audience</p>
<p>Here are 2 money making strategies that will complement your online business built to serve your readers well.</p>
<h3>There&#8217;s Great Power in the Webinar</h3>
<p>Webinars are a powerful way to humanize your brand as it gives you the opportunity to interact with your participants in real-time with quality audio and video. It&#8217;s the next best thing to face to face conversations and performs much better than social media and other channels since you&#8217;re engaging an audience that has opted in to consume what you have to offer; leads that are already qualified. Therefore, if you&#8217;re selling something and you host a webinar to talk about your offer, it&#8217;s likely that your participants are in buying mode. As a matter of fact, well executed <a href="http://www.rightmixmarketing.com/webinars-and-public-speaking/webinar-attendee-registration-stats/" target="_blank">webinars typically enjoy a conversion rate of up to 42%</a>, which is unheard of with other media.</p>
<p><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-30832" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/webinar-stats-585x140.png" alt="webinar-stats" width="585" height="140" /></p>
<p><strong>Two ways to approach webinars for increasing earnings:</strong></p>
<p>1) Have a new product or service offering? Instead of promoting the product itself, invite readers to a webinar where you talk about the problem that your product solves and the frustrations in the industry. Direct the focal point of the webinar to sharing user experiences with that particular difficulty and then demonstrate how your product can help. The above average benefit here is that you&#8217;re building a relationship with your audience of highly targeted individuals who know they may want your product.</p>
<p>This is much more effective at closing sales than blog posts and standard advertising where you&#8217;re not 100% engaged with the user.</p>
<p>2) Or, if you have a highly specialized skill; deliver a webinar on your insight along with resources that cannot be found elsewhere on the web. Use a webinar service like <a href="https://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/" target="_blank">Google Hangouts</a> or <a href="http://www.clickwebinar.com" target="_blank">ClickWebinar</a> to save your video presentation. This presentation, presuming it&#8217;s of uniquely high value, can be sold at a nominal rate for others to access.</p>
<h3>Sponsored Content on Steroids</h3>
<p>Although sponsored content / native advertising has been <a href="http://contently.com/strategist/2014/08/04/john-oliver-roasts-native-advertising-in-hilarious-fashion/" target="_blank">receiving a lot of criticism lately</a>, I do believe that once it&#8217;s done properly from the perspective of adding authentic value for the reader; there&#8217;s nothing wrong if the content was created by and for Pepsi, for example. The problem here is that many writers and companies are doing it wrong and subsidizing quality and ignoring the readers&#8217; intelligence.</p>
<p><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-30834" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/blogger-fee-sponsored-content-585x351.jpg" alt="blogger-fee-sponsored-content" width="585" height="351" /></p>
<p>Depending on your website&#8217;s traffic you can potentially earn anywhere from $25 to $1,000 for a single sponsored post.</p>
<p><strong>To stand out with your website&#8217;s sponsored content offer and charge advertisers more, here&#8217;s what you do:</strong></p>
<p>1) Get rid of the 500 &#8211; 800 word limit on the work you produce. Give more value; provide in-depth research to back what you&#8217;re writing to deliver a credible product for your advertiser.</p>
<p>2) Create visually appealing sponsored posts that rely heavily on artwork and quality graphics. If your advertiser would like to use stats or any other concept in their article, present it beautifully. You may need to hire a graphic designer to prepare something quickly for you but if you&#8217;re giving a premium product then you can charge more. Look at the quality content <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/blog/" target="_blank">Neil publishes on his blog</a>, that&#8217;s what you should aim for.</p>
<p>Poor quality sponsored posts do not add value  to the advertisers&#8217; visibility or SEO performance since Google is leaning more towards naturally substantive content. It&#8217;s time to offer more.</p>
<p>To conclude, running a profitable, cash rich business online seems to always rest on the foundation of delivering quality content; something that your audience finds interesting, entertaining and useful. The days of gaming search engine&#8217;s for financial gain are quickly coming to an end as Google and other search engines clamp down on removing low quality websites from their index. As you implement strategies to earn, please the customer first and you&#8217;ll be inspired to create content and products worth buying.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone has his reasons for blogging. Some treat their blog as a business. Some blog for their business. Others blog just because they can.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, however, most bloggers want one thing: <strong>to have a huge reader base.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/increase.jpg"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-30826" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/increase-585x329.jpg" alt="grow your reader base" width="585" height="329" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/61423903@N06/" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
<p>What&#8217;s the point of having something to say, and saying it in an awesome way, when there&#8217;s no one reading your blog?</p>
<p>You may have a couple hundred, or maybe a couple thousand, readers, but ask yourself if you&#8217;re really satisfied with staying at &#8211; more or less &#8211; the same amount of readers. The chances are that you&#8217;re not. You want to grow your blog. You want to grow your reader base, and here are three simple things you can do to get that done.<span id="more-30822"></span></p>
<h2>1. Create a subscriber list.</h2>
<p>This might be one of the more overlooked aspects of growing one&#8217;s reader base. For new bloggers, especially, there is sometimes the misconception that if you create something good, people will come. While that may be true in some cases, to a certain extent, the reality is that you almost always have to expend some effort getting people to come to you.</p>
<p>One thing you can do is to make use of an <a href="http://freshmail.com/" target="_blank">email marketing tool</a> that will help you establish and grow your subscriber list. More than simply gathering email addresses, this kind of tool will help you retain subscribers by:</p>
<ul>
<li>providing analytic tools to determine what kind of content works</li>
<li>providing attractive email templates</li>
<li>providing personalization features.</li>
</ul>
<p>With time, you can grow your reader base by reaching out to them.</p>
<h2>2. Grow your Facebook/Twitter fan base.</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/social-media.jpg"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-30825" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/social-media-585x307.jpg" alt="grow your reader base" width="585" height="307" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hikingartist/" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
<p>Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms play a crucial role if you want to grow your reader base. These platforms are venues in which you can get the word out about your blog. You don&#8217;t even need statistics to be convinced of this. Just think about how many web sites and blogs you have discovered via Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p>As such, your blog should have its own social media accounts, but more than that, you should work at growing your fan base on those platforms.</p>
<p>How can you do this?</p>
<ul>
<li>Update regularly, but do not flood your fans&#8217; feeds/streams with one post after another. Space out your posts.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t be a mere broadcaster of your own content. Share content from other sites, content which is relevant to your blog.</li>
<li>Vary the type of content you share &#8211; links, images, and text. Find out which type <a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/archives/2010/04/01/4-ways-to-elicit-emotion-from-blog-readers/" target="_blank">incites your followers to interact</a> best.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.jeffbullas.com/2014/01/16/5-twitter-marketing-tactics-for-building-a-fanatical-following/" target="_blank">Interact with influencers in your niche</a>. The beauty of social media is that you can interact with anyone &#8211; especially on Twitter. Identify the influencers in your niche and interact with them. A simple reply to a tweet of theirs is a good start. If you provide good conversation, you just might get noticed.</li>
<li>Interact with your own followers. If you get comments, reply. If you get shares, replies, or retweets, tweet back &#8211; a simple thank you works wonders.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Be consistent in publishing tailored content.</h2>
<p>You can do all the marketing and promotion you want, but if you are erratic in publishing content, then you might as well give up on wanting to grow your reader base. At the very core, what counts is that you regularly provide content that appeals to your audience. Know who your audience is, and tailor your content so that they will want to read what you write &#8211; and come back to read more in the future.</p>
<p>Do you really want to grow your reader base? Start with these three things, and you&#8217;ll see results.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve all had those periods when writing feels like a chore instead of an activity that we actually love. You&#8217;ve probably proclaimed how passionate you are about writing more than once &#8211; especially when you&#8217;re <a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/archives/2014/08/08/job-application-gets-ignored/" target="_blank">applying for a gig</a> &#8211; but the &#8220;I hate writing&#8221; moments do come now and again.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/writer-crushed.jpg"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-30817" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/writer-crushed-585x438.jpg" alt="don't feel like writing" width="585" height="438" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="don't feel like writing" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/42931449@N07/" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
<p>What are you to do when you just don&#8217;t feel like writing? Here are five things that have proven to be effective for me. Sometimes, when I really, really don&#8217;t feel like writing, it takes a combination of these activities to get me back on track.<span id="more-30814"></span></p>
<h2>1. Force yourself.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A professional writer is an amateur who didn&#8217;t quit.&#8221; &#8211; Richard Bach</p></blockquote>
<p>If you&#8217;re reading this, then the chances are that you are a professional writer &#8211; or at least you think yourself to be. But, professional or not, those &#8220;I don&#8217;t feel like writing&#8221; times still happen. When they do, remember this quote. Don&#8217;t quit.</p>
<p><strong>Force yourself. You can do it.</strong></p>
<h2>2. Go out for coffee.</h2>
<p>After that rather direct piece of advice, I have to admit that it doesn&#8217;t always work &#8211; at least not always in a positive way. Sure, forcing yourself is always an option, and if you&#8217;re determined enough, you will always get the work done.</p>
<p><em>The question is: what is the quality of the resulting work?</em></p>
<p>Probably crappy.</p>
<p>So, I will eat humble pie and admit that forcing myself when I don&#8217;t feel like writing isn&#8217;t always the best option. And while I&#8217;m at it, I&#8217;ll drink coffee with that pie. Literally.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/pie-and-coffee.jpg"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-30819" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/pie-and-coffee-585x393.jpg" alt="don't feel like writing" width="585" height="393" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aloha75/" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t force yourself, go to your favorite coffee shop, cafe, bistro, pub, or whatever and have something to drink and/or eat. After that, you&#8217;ll probably feel much better and ready to write again.</p>
<h2>3. Browse entertaining web sites.</h2>
<p>If you can&#8217;t &#8211; or don&#8217;t want to &#8211; go out, then by all means stay at home and stay connected. Don&#8217;t write, but waste time on wonderfully, sillily, and entertainingly sites such as Reddit, 9GAG, College Humor, or whatever your guilty pleasure may be. Spend 30 minutes to an hour relaxing your brain on your favorite sites (which may require you to actually NOT think). See how that helps you want to write again.</p>
<h2>4. Play a game.</h2>
<p>If you like playing video games, then it&#8217;s a no brainer. You don&#8217;t feel like writing, and forcing yourself doesn&#8217;t work? Grab your iPad, iPhone, PS3/Xbox controller and game to your heart&#8217;s content. A brilliant blog post idea or two might even hit you while you&#8217;re playing. (Yes, it&#8217;s been known to happen.)</p>
<h2>5. Take a nap.</h2>
<p>If all else fails, nothing works better than a nap. If you take a look at my <a href="http://twitter.com/noemiruth" target="_blank">Twitter bio</a>, you&#8217;ll understand. I&#8217;m a pro at napping, and it does wonders for productivity (<a href="http://io9.com/the-science-behind-power-naps-and-why-theyre-so-damne-1401366016" target="_blank">there&#8217;s science behind that</a>), mood, and creativity.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Send-to-WordPress.png"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-30800" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Send-to-WordPress-585x272.png" alt="Send to WordPress Chrome" width="585" height="272" /></a></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how much you rely on Google Drive, but it is pretty much the easiest and most convenient way of sharing documents between team members. And even if you work alone, there are times when Google Docs is more convenient to use &#8211; say, when you&#8217;re on the road and you want to make sure you have a copy of a document or post safe in the cloud.</p>
<p>When it&#8217;s time to post that article to your WordPress blog, then it&#8217;s a simple matter of copying and pasting the content, right?</p>
<p>But what if there&#8217;s an even easier way of doing that?<span id="more-30799"></span></p>
<p>Enter &#8220;Send to WordPress&#8221;, a Chrome extension that does just that: send Google documents straight to your WordPress blog. Assuming you&#8217;re a <a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/archives/2012/07/27/finding-out-which-browser-is-best-for-blogging/" target="_blank">Chrome user</a>, then you have to at least try this extension out.</p>
<p>The beauty of this extension is that it gives you the capability of exporting a Google Drive document as a WordPress blog post &#8211; formatting and images all included! You don&#8217;t have to worry about losing hyperlinks, tags, and all important elements of a blog post.</p>
<p>You simply have to install the Chrome extension, and you will see a new option in Google Drive which allows you to send to WordPress, as you can see in the image above.</p>
<p>You will, of course, have to link your WordPress account in order to get things going.</p>
<p>Now here&#8217;s a question that may be bugging you: Why not just use WordPress directly?</p>
<p>Three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Collaboration. If you&#8217;re working with other people on a post, this extension will come in very handy.</li>
<li>When you can&#8217;t access your WordPress site for whatever reason, you can still create your post and follow your schedule, and then later send the post to the blog.</li>
<li>When you have no Internet connection, what are you to do? It seems unimaginable for this to happen in this day and age, but yes, it does happen. With <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2375012?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=2375188" target="_blank">Google Drive having offline mode</a>, you can still continue working on a blog post as you normally would and just send it to WordPress later on.</li>
</ol>
<p>Get <a title="Send to WordPress Chrome extension" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/send-to-wordpress/nbljnjmeckdecofjohdobgmleppiikll" target="_blank">Send to WordPress</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: This post was written by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100006619728494" target="_blank">Nick Robson</a>, an SEO expert and presently works as a consultant helping out those who need his assistance. He loves writing and combines this passion of his with his knowledge of SEO.</em></p>
<p>Every business wants to improve the number of visitors to their website and create a brand name for themselves, that’s how you become successful. But doing so can oftentimes be challenging, especially if you are unfamiliar with snippets and how they can be used to increase the appeal of your brand.</p>
<p>Snippets are small pieces of metadata that are gathered based on customer preferences and the services your business offers that are used to help bring attention to your site. Google will actually use these snippets to help provide their searchers with a preview as to what your site/ business has to offer.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/snippets.jpg"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30796" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/snippets.jpg" alt="snippets" width="439" height="208" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/99170?hl=en" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
<p>There are a number of great benefits to having quality snippets, as outlined in the Huffington Post’s <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/piyush-mangukiya/rich-snippets_b_3853235.html" target="_blank">Use the Power of Rich Snippets to Boost Your Google Ranking</a>. Better snippets can help you to get more attention on search engines and make the links of your business stand out more. Customers want to click on links that offer what they are searching for and deal with businesses that have great reviews. As yourself how often you search for a business that has poor customer feedback? Never, right?!<span id="more-30795"></span></p>
<p>Not to mention that, by attracting more visitors to your website and allowing them to become familiar with your products, you are building your brand.Every click that your snippet draws to your site is simply another opportunity for you to get your business name out to the public and build sales. Your snippet can bring customers to your site, and beyond that it is your job to keep them there!</p>
<p><strong>Finding Beneficial Soft Inputs</strong></p>
<p>One of the best ways to create pages that are snippet rich is by seeking out soft inputs from your customers and target audience. Soft inputs include the information that your customers share about your business, including product feedback, sharing product uses and customer service raves. Viewers want to see that other people truly like your products and like your business, that will make them more inclined to shop with you.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/macrumors.jpg"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30797" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/macrumors.jpg" alt="snippets" width="375" height="236" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2011/05/04/apple-soliciting-customer-feedback-with-new-pulse-program/" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
<p>So, where is the best place to find these opinions and inputs?</p>
<p>There are a number of great sources to choose from, including social media sites, customer surveys, reviews and more. It is oftentimes for this reason that you will see companies, like Apple (above) or WordPress, as explained by BloggingPro.com’s <a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/archives/2009/07/10/wordpress-media-features-surve/" target="_blank">WordPress Media Features Survey</a>, ask for user input.</p>
<p>While these surveys don’t have to be extensive in length, you want them to lead your customers to provide input on the service they received and your products. Other brands have actually turned to third party companies like to help reach out to their customers through <a href="http://www.continentalmessage.com/services/answering-service/virtual-receptionist" target="_blank">phone enabled surveys</a> and cold calling. This is a quick, simple and affordable way to reach out to all your target customers.</p>
<p>If you keep your eyes and ears open to this feedback from customers you might actually be surprised to see and hear feedback every day.</p>
<p><strong>Building Your Brand</strong></p>
<p>So, now that you know how important snippets are for your business, you can start to focus on creating and getting the input from your customers that you need to promote your brand. Keep in mind that getting the positive feedback that you want starts with having quality products and good customer service. The last thing you need is to have either of the two causing your customers to give you poor feedback and having snippets that are just mediocre. That’s no way to generate business or build your brand.</p>
<p>Start your search for soft input today and start taking advantage of soft snippets today!!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A blogger&#8217;s professional life is more uncertain than conventional employees. We may have several revenue streams, which is good, as we don&#8217;t put all our eggs in one basket. There may be months when we&#8217;re flush, maybe even with too much work to handle.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/cents.jpg"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-30784" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/cents-585x390.jpg" alt="The Quest for Change" width="585" height="390" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/34316967@N04/" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
<p>Then there are those low revenue periods, which are inevitable. Just as awesome months always happen, periods with little revenue coming in are also to be expected. No matter how many clients you have, no matter how many blogs you run, you&#8217;re bound to have low revenue periods.</p>
<p>How do you protect yourself from &#8211; and get through &#8211; these periods?<span id="more-30780"></span></p>
<h2>Prepare.</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s no better way to make sure you get through low revenue periods than to prepare for them. Knowing they will come at some point, the smart thing to do is put away cash every time something comes in. Consider that your emergency money, untouchable unless it&#8217;s absolutely neccessary.</p>
<h2>Take out a loan.</h2>
<p>When low revenue periods strike, you may or may not have prior warning. In any case, you have the option of getting a loan from various sources, which can be a godsend. In the economic downturn, <a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/1290763/the-title-loan-industry-is-looking-good-this-year/" target="_blank">title loans have become more popular</a>. This is due to a variety of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Title loans have fast processing times.</li>
<li>Title loans don&#8217;t have a lot of requirements.</li>
<li>There are a lot of title loan providers.</li>
</ul>
<p>City Loan, for example, offers convenient auto title loan services based on the value of the vehicle with <strong>no credit check</strong>. That in itself makes their services very attractive, especially when you find yourself facing something totally unexpected.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/car.jpg"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-30783" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/car-585x388.jpg" alt="car" width="585" height="388" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hansel5569/" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
<p>Whether you&#8217;ve <a href="http //www.everyjoe.com/2014/07/02/lifestyle/car-title-loans-can-remedy-financial-problems/" target="_blank">lost a big client, and your revenue stream suffers a serious hit, or you get into an accident, or you get ill</a>, you can take out a title loan as long as you have a vehicle which you can use as collateral.</p>
<p>This market is really growing, and as Bryan Gilloly, VP of Sales and Operation of City Loan, says:</p>
<p><em>We are excited to bring The City Loan difference to new markets. We have built excellent relationships with many customers in California and look forward to providing the same level of service and financial help that many people need in these new states.</em></p>
<h2>Spend the minimum you can.</h2>
<p>You may have a nest egg, or you may have gotten some cash via a loan, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you should spend left and right. You still need to get through your lean period, and until you are sure your revenue stream is at a level that you&#8217;re comfortable with again, the best thing to do is to cut back on expenses.</p>
<p>It may seem scary and uncomfortable at first, especially if you&#8217;re used to a certain lifestyle. It&#8217;s not that hard to adjust, though, if you psych yourself into spending less. You might even find out that living more simply is better for you.</p>
<h2>Keep looking for jobs.</h2>
<p>When you&#8217;re having a bad period, you might be tempted to sink into a rut. That&#8217;s the easy thing to do. However, the better thing to do would be to keep going. If you&#8217;ve lost a client, look for new ones. Scour <a title="BloggingPro Job Board" href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/jobs" target="_blank">job boards</a>. Even if you don&#8217;t find a new job immediately, or you don&#8217;t get a response, just keep going. Keep sending out those applications.</p>
<p>Additionally, take time to visit <a title="Freelance writing resources" href="http://www.freelancewritinggigs.com/resources/" target="_blank">freelance writing resources</a>, where you may be able to find contests, jobs, and calls for submissions on top of writing tips.</p>
<p><strong>The bottom line: don&#8217;t despair. Make a few adjustments, and continue what you do. Sooner or later, the revenue will start coming in again.</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/WordPress-Starter-Kit.png"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-30787" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/WordPress-Starter-Kit-585x217.png" alt="WordPress Starter Kit" width="585" height="217" /></a></p>
<p>WordPress has become the blogging platform of choice for many &#8211; individuals and businesses alike. With the host of features integrated, not to mention countless plugins that can be used to customize and enhance the final product, WordPress is certainly not to be ignored (although it has its fair share of naysayers).</p>
<p>If you are starting a WordPress site, or even if you already have one, but you want to take full advantage of what the platform has to offer, then you will want to catch this deal from Cult of Mac.<span id="more-30786"></span></p>
<p>I normally stay away from copy that promises you&#8217;ll be an expert on a subject matter in X number of hours, but after perusing the 0-100 WordPress Starter Kit, I do think that the deal is something that one who works with WordPress shouldn&#8217;t pass up on.</p>
<p>The 0-100 WordPress Starter Kit includes themes and tutorials:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 &#8220;Plug &amp; Play&#8221; WordPress Themes</li>
<li>Building Custom WordPress Sites from Scratch</li>
<li>WordPress for E-commerce Tutorial &#8211; a Definitive Guide</li>
<li>Create a WordPress Website &#8211; No Coding Required</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/archives/2014/06/23/how-where-buy-wordpress-theme/" target="_blank">WordPress Theme Selection</a> &amp; Customization</li>
<li>Web Guard Dog WordPress Security</li>
<li>Design, Develop &amp; Sell WordPress Themes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>All these (normally) amount to $816. With the sale, you only have to pay $49. </strong></p>
<p>What&#8217;s the catch? You might not need all those tutorials, and you probably won&#8217;t be a WP Pro in a weekend as the page says, but at this price, it&#8217;s really a good deal. And you can always go back to the tutorials when the need arises.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><em>Editor&#8217;s note: This post was written by Larry Alton, an independent business consultant specializing in social media trends, business, and entrepreneurship. Follow him on <a href="https://twitter.com/LarryAlton3" target="_blank"><span class="s3">Twitter</span></a> and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=274098745&amp;authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;authToken=t2-i&amp;locale=en_US&amp;srchid=495336961386366229268&amp;srchindex=10&amp;srchtotal=10&amp;trk=vsrp_people_res_name&amp;trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A495336961386366229268%2CVSRPtargetId%3A274098745%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary" target="_blank"><span class="s3">LinkedIn.</span></a></em></p>
<p class="p3">When you were an angsty teen posting on LiveJournal, you probably never thought your <a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/archives/2014/07/31/the-first-5-things-you-need-to-hear-before-you-start-blogging/" target="_blank">love for blogging</a> could turn into a very lucrative career one day. However, there’s more than one way to be successful at blogging: You can become a famous blogger with throngs of followers, all based on your skills/personality/talents or a mixture of them all, or you can learn to monetize blogs. Monetizing blogs is much more technical with little creativity, and those who make millions are rarely famous.</p>
<p class="p3">Unsurprisingly, it’s much more fun (and inspirational) to focus on the rich and famous bloggers. If you’re looking for a little inspiration, these wealthy bloggers have it in spades and they’re not shy about sharing their secrets.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>1. Arianna Huffington</b></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Arianna-Huffington.jpg"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter wp-image-30773 size-large" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Arianna-Huffington-585x532.jpg" alt="get rich blogging" width="585" height="532" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span id="more-30771"></span>Yes, The Huffington Post is a blog but it’s also become a go-to reputable news resource. Founded by Arianna Huffington along with Kenneth Lerer, Jonah Peretti and Andrewe Breitbart, it was created in 2005 and just one year later got a $5 million investment from a bank. Hard core fundraising and savvy investing led to $15 million in funding a couple years later, then was sold to AOL in 2011 for a shocking $315 million.</p>
<p class="p3"><em>The lesson here: Focus on mass appeal, don’t go to extreme, and there’s <a title="get rich blogging" href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2014/02/the-best-investment-advice-youll-never-get-2/" target="_blank"><span class="s1">no substitute for smart investing</span></a> and fundraising.</em></p>
<p class="p3"><b>2. Gina Marie Trapani</b></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Gina-Marie-Trapani.jpg"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter wp-image-30774 size-large" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Gina-Marie-Trapani-585x609.jpg" alt="get rich blogging" width="585" height="609" /></a></p>
<p class="p3">The founder of Lifehacker, Trapani isn’t a household name like Huffington but she doesn’t need to be. Also launched in 2005, she made her millions largely from advertising and depending on something everyone wants: Easier ways to do just about anything. However, it was the <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/217913" target="_blank"><span class="s1">Sony sponsorship</span></a> that really sealed the deal, and today the blog is worth an estimated $109 million.</p>
<p class="p3"><em>The lesson here: If you have a strong sales/marketing/ad background, use it. If not, learn it.</em></p>
<p class="p3"><b>3. Kevin P. Ryan</b></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Kevin-P.-Ryan.jpg"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter wp-image-30775 size-large" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Kevin-P.-Ryan-585x532.jpg" alt="get rich blogging" width="585" height="532" /></a></p>
<p class="p3">As the founder of Business Insider, Ryan’s blog is worth a cool $3 million. Balancing business with entertainment, it sidestepped the boring approach that many biz blogs use. Today, it’s considered one of the best sources for business news, but Ryan focused on <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/80458" target="_blank"><span class="s1">wooing the right investors</span></a> who wanted their products and services featured.</p>
<p class="p3"><em>The lesson here: It’s always wise to play to the egos and wallets of wealthy investors.</em></p>
<p class="p3"><b>4. Pete Cashmore</b></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Pete-Cashmore.jpg"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-30776" src="http://www.bloggingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Pete-Cashmore-585x647.jpg" alt="get rich blogging" width="585" height="647" /></a></p>
<p class="p3">It seems that Cashmore’s name was a sign from destiny, so it’s no surprise that his Mashable blog is one of the most popular blogs around. When he first launched the site in 2005, he was just a teenager. Today, it’s one of the biggest websites around the globe (that’s “website” not just “blog”) and although the actual dollar amount for his sell to CNN in 2012 is hush-hush, it’s estimated to be around $200 million.</p>
<p class="p3"><em>The lesson here: You’re never too young, old or broke to have a multi-million dollar idea. If a teen boy can do it, so can you.</em></p>
<p class="p3">For those who have a penchant for technology and a desire to make a living doing what they love, a successful blog doesn’t have to be a pipe dream. You do, however, need total commitment, and you just might get rich blogging like these four people.</p>
