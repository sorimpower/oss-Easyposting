<p>During the 35 minute webinar you&#8217;ll hear Adam Greco (Adobe Analytics expert) along with Siping Roussin (from Lenovo) and Joseph Fuerst (from ClickTale) discuss how ClickTale&#8217;s Digital Customer Experience insights enabled Lenovo to better monetize their Adobe Analytics target segments.</p>
<h3>Why are Customer Experience Insights Important?</h3>
<p>Because without understanding the behavior of specific target audiences, you won&#8217;t be able to get them to convert well. Another way of saying this is, if you only provide a one-size-fits-all web experience, then you&#8217;re not going to be able to focus on high value visitors &#8211; the ones that are likely to bring you the most money.</p>
<h3><a href="http://blog.clicktale.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/options.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-9635" src="http://blog.clicktale.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/options-300x212.jpg" alt="options 300x212 Using Digital Customer Experience to Monetize Your Web Analytics Segments" width="277" height="196" title="Using Digital Customer Experience to Monetize Your Web Analytics Segments" /></a>So Why Can&#8217;t I Just Stick With My Web Analytics?</h3>
<p>Web analytics are great. Every online marketing team needs to have web analytics data to understand where and how they acquire visitors to their website and to segment those visitors into identifiable groups.</p>
<p>But what then? Web Analytics will only tell you if a webpage is working or not. But it won&#8217;t tell you <em>why</em>. Enter Digital Customer Experience technology: Using sophisticated browser recording technology and heatmapping, you&#8217;re able to track the &#8216;experience&#8217; of individual web visitors as they journey through your site. Not only that &#8211; but you can then view engagement trends, click trends, scroll trends and mouse move trends for all of those target groups you created on your web analytics tool.  And the result:</p>
<h3>Greater Personalization = More Monetization</h3>
<p>That&#8217;s exactly how Lenovo used ClickTale to provide actionable behavioral intelligence into their Adobe Analytics segments. Using the insights learned they were able to develop a more targeted experience for their different audiences. Using ClickTale, they were able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand how purchasers and non-purchasers experience their website differently</li>
<li>Determine which actions lead to purchase and why non-purchase occurs for some visitors</li>
<li>What elements to emphasize in order to generate more conversion</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blog.clicktale.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/engagement-time.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-10479 size-medium" src="http://blog.clicktale.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/engagement-time-300x177.jpg" alt="engagement time 300x177 Time on Page vs Visitor Engagement Time" width="300" height="177" title="Time on Page vs Visitor Engagement Time" /></a>Traditionally, “Time on Page” has been the most common metric used to measure engagement with the content of a page. But Time on Page tells you one thing and one thing only – how long a visitor had a web page open for.</p>
<p>The trouble is, most users will often open a new tab, read for a short time, then minimize their browser or even go off and do something else while keeping the browser open.</p>
<p>All of this is normal browsing behavior, but it gives rise to one major point: “Time on Page” tells us nearly nothing about how and how long visitors actually interact with your online content!</p>
<p>Instead, &#8220;Engagement Time&#8221; is the metric that we should all be talking and using.</p>
<p>Engagement Time is also a metric that&#8217;s unique to ClickTale and shows literally the time visitors were actively engaged with your site, like reading your content, looking at your pictures, watching your videos and browsing your products.</p>
<p>Engagement Time tells you how long that page held their attention rather than just the time that that page was opened in their browsers.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.clicktale.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Engagement-vs-time-on-page.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10473 size-full" src="http://blog.clicktale.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Engagement-vs-time-on-page.png" alt="Engagement vs time on page Time on Page vs Visitor Engagement Time" width="835" height="607" title="Time on Page vs Visitor Engagement Time" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see from the above graph, Time on Page can change drastically &#8211; in part because it can be skewed by normal browsing behavior. User Engagement Time however, provides a far more steady, reliable and more representative statistic of visitor behavior.</p>
<h2>3 Reasons Why Visitors May Not be Engaging:</h2>
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve established that Engagement Time is far more important a measure of optimization than Time on Page, what are the sort of issues that may be harming your site&#8217;s engagement? Here are the three most common ones:</p>
<p><strong>1: Content is not meeting visitor expectations. </strong>This could be causing high bounce rates because the content is not interesting enough for the visitor. Perhaps they are looking for something more relevant that does not currently exist on the page.</p>
<p><strong>2: Page is hard to navigate to article or feature of choice. </strong>The page is poorly laid out and can therefore seem overwhelming or confusing for the visitor.</p>
<p><strong>3: The content could not be loading properly, or at all. </strong>This could be because there&#8217;s too much redirection or loading time. Also, there could be JavaScript errors on the page. Or, visitors could be clicking on an article thinking that it will open but instead, get redirected to another page.</p>
<h2>Time to Start Measuring Visitor Engagement</h2>
<p>ClickTale&#8217;s advanced family of heat-maps provide a range of metrics that enable you to accurately identifying engagement time for desktop and mobile websites. This will enable your team to quickly and accurately identify which of the three issues above are causing poor engagement.</p>
<p>From mouse move heatmaps, to attention heatmaps and scroll reach heatmaps &#8211; all of these enable web performance and marketing specialists tp understand where visitors are really engaging <em>within</em> your web pages. And if you think you&#8217;ve spotted a trend, then simply drill down into the Session Playback to watch full browser sessions to confirm why visitors may or may not be engaging.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://blog.clicktale.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Anderson-2_to_use.png"><img class="alignright wp-image-10454 " src="http://blog.clicktale.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Anderson-2_to_use-199x300.png" alt="Anderson 2 to use 199x300 No More Guesswork with Customer Feedback and Digital Experience Integration!" width="182" height="274" title="No More Guesswork with Customer Feedback and Digital Experience Integration!" /></a>Guest Post by Duff Anderson, SVP iPerceptions</em></p>
<p>Imagine you see a spike in cart abandonment and start watching visitor browser sessions to better understand the reasons why.</p>
<p>Good. But what if you could then prioritize the top reasons for cart abandonment and just watch those sessions in context with the specific feedback provided by your web visitors?</p>
<p>Or what if you could contextualize each session you watch with the actual intent of the visitor? This is what iPerceptions and ClickTale have teamed up to create, an integrated solution that gives marketers a holistic view of the customer experience by combining the <em>voice of your customer</em> with their <em>digital customer experience</em>.</p>
<h2>A method for zooming in on what’s important</h2>
<p>By combining iPerceptions and ClickTale insights you can guide and focus your efforts using representative feedback left by your customers. For example, you can segment your ClickTale session recordings to focus just on the visitors who rated your site experience as below 3 out of 10. This allows you to focus on customers that had a poor experience &#8211; and then with ClickTale, replay the sessions, to better understand what the customer went through that led to that poor experience.</p>
<h2>Get inside your customer’s mind</h2>
<p>Sometimes you might watch a visitor’s session and wonder what what was the intent of the visitor. Was he or she on your site to buy or just to browse? One of the main advantages of adding customer feedback to your session analysis is the ability to know exactly what the visitor was thinking while on your site. For each session you can add additional datapoints such as next steps, visitor intent and verbatim from open-ended questions. This provides critical context to help better understand the needs and wants of your visitors.</p>
<h2><a href="http://blog.clicktale.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ClickTale-iPerception-integration.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10460" src="http://blog.clicktale.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ClickTale-iPerception-integration-300x246.png" alt="ClickTale iPerception integration 300x246 No More Guesswork with Customer Feedback and Digital Experience Integration!" width="300" height="246" title="No More Guesswork with Customer Feedback and Digital Experience Integration!" /></a>So how does the integration work?</h2>
<p>The integration starts with engaging your visitors in the moment of truth using an iPerceptions representative survey to collect qualitative customer insights such as visitor intent, needs, and experiences.</p>
<p>When a visitor accepts an iPerceptions on-arrival survey invitation this automatically triggers a ClickTale Session Playback recording meaning that all your customer feedback will have an associated ClickTale session recording.</p>
<p>Then within the iPerceptions Active Research SaaS Platform you can analyze your results with advanced reporting, benchmarking, and segment your insights to pinpoint certain groups to prioritize which sessions to watch. This gives you the power to deep dive into the customer experience and extract the maximum insights from every visitor.</p>
<h2>Deeper understanding of the customer experience</h2>
<p>The new iPerceptions ClickTale integration is a powerful solution that gives an in-depth understanding of the online behavior and in-page experience of visitors who have voiced feedback about your website.</p>
<p>Now you can better utilize your resources by quickly identifying the right sessions to focus on and then align them to your business objectives to rapidly get the insights you need to more effectively optimize the website experience, reduce maintenance costs and improve online conversion.</p>

<h3>When? Tuesday September 9th, 11:00-11:35AM CST/5:00-5:35PM UK</h3>
<h2><a href="http://research.clicktale.com/Q314-Demystified-Webinar_Social-LP.html" target="_blank"><strong>Register Here</strong></a></h2>
<p>In this 35 minute webinar Adam Greco (Adobe Analytics expert), Siping Roussin (Lenovo) and Joseph Fuerst (ClickTale) discuss and explain:</p>
<ul>
<li>How Lenovo used ClickTale and Adobe Analytics to provide actionable insights into their most valuable target audience segments</li>
<li>How purchasers and non-purchasers experience a website differently</li>
<li>How to determine which actions lead to purchase and why failure occurs for non-purchasers</li>
<li>What elements to emphasize in order to create conversion success and what elements to eliminate to prevent bounce</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why You Should Attend this Webinar:</h3>
<p>In this <a href="http://blog.clicktale.com/2014/08/14/4-facts-that-will-change-how-you-do-online-marketing/" target="_blank">recent blog post</a> we highlighted one of the most pressing issues facing online marketing today; that they simply don&#8217;t know enough about the vast majority of visitors that leave their websites without converting.</p>
<p>Web analytics, while essential, is not giving the answers or the insights into why visitors leave or why they may have a negative online experience.</p>
<h3><a href="http://blog.clicktale.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/lenovo-logo.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-10439 size-medium" src="http://blog.clicktale.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/lenovo-logo-300x94.jpg" alt="lenovo logo 300x94 Using Digital Customer Experience to Monetize Your Web Analytics Segments (Webinar)" width="300" height="94" title="Using Digital Customer Experience to Monetize Your Web Analytics Segments (Webinar)" /></a>Enter the Lenovo User Case!</h3>
<p>Lenovo is one company that is managing to solve this problem effectively. Using advanced user visualization tracking technology they are able to quickly identify where customers may have negative experiences and then alleviate them simply and quickly.</p>
<p>In the image below you can see the Lenovo homepage &#8211; with ClickTale&#8217;s Side-by-Side Heatmap superimposed to show where customers are engaging most. Along with the Adobe Analytics integration, the marketing gurus at Lenovo were able to compare the page experience for<em> purchasers</em> (the left hand heat-map) vs. <em>non-purchasers</em> (the right hand heat map).</p>
<p>By understanding what factors of the web page encouraged engagement, Lenovo were able to significantly increase their page optimization and generate more online revenue.</p>
<p>The bottom line? This webinar is for you if you want to better understand what really generates web conversion!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A heatmap is a way of visualizing data using color coding to represent different values in a two-dimensional image.</p>
<p>As to be expected there are many different types of heatmaps that are used in a range of disciplines from physical sciences to entertainment to web optimization. Although they may all use the term &#8216;heat map&#8217; to describe the data-image they produce, actually there are many different types of visualization techniques.</p>
<p>Here are some of the most interesting heat maps that I&#8217;ve encountered:</p>
<h3>A Tsunami Height Heat Map</h3>
<p>This heat map uses color to show the maximum tsunami height within the first 24 hours after the 8.9 magnitude earthquake that struck off the coast of Japan on March 11, 2011. (Courtesy of NOAA/PMEL/Center for Tsunami Research)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3> Facebook vs Twitter Global Coverage Heat Map</h3>
<p>These heat maps highlight the differences between these two social media giants. Twitter coverage is far more concentrated in European and Eastern US pockets while Facebook connections are shown spanning the continents and oceans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Eye Tracking Heat Map: Women vs Men</h3>
<p>Think Eye Tracking showed the following picture to thirty men and thirty women for five seconds while they were being eye tracked. Much to some people&#8217;s surprise, the heat map showing what women most looked at is on the left, while the men&#8217;s results is on the right.</p>

<h3>ClickTale&#8217;s Heat Mapping Technology Explained</h3>
<p>The above heat map examples all work because they provide us with an overall spacial view of data that would otherwise be difficult to absorb at a single sitting and even more difficult to create actionable improvements from if the data were presented as numbers in a chart.</p>
<p>Taking this into the world of web optimization and conversion, we can now understand how customer experience heat mapping technology is revolutionizing the way marketing professionals understand their web visitors&#8217; in-page behavior.  The video below shows the different types of heat maps that ClickTale offers as part of its Digital Customer Experience tracking software.</p>

We don&#8217;t know enough about <em>why</em> they leave. And we don&#8217;t know the specific issues, if any, that were responsible for their negative experience.</p>
<p>But, we do know the<em> impact</em> of those lost visitors on the business. We&#8217;ve even provided these <a href="http://blog.clicktale.com/2014/08/14/4-facts-that-will-change-how-you-do-online-marketing/" target="_blank">4 facts</a> to support the case in our last blog post.</p>
<p>In this new infographic below, we take it a step further by showing, not only the business impact of not understanding your website visitors (loss of revenue, customer churn, higher costs and damage to your brand),  but also what you can do about it with ClickTale, using the company&#8217;s in-page customer experience technology that gives you a real, over-the-shoulder view of your customers&#8217; digital experience.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few years ago everyone was talking about the importance of measuring the success of our websites and marketing campaigns. Now the conversation has shifted towards the idea of measuring and optimizing not just individual campaigns &#8211; but the whole online customer experience.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.clicktale.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/maze2.png"><img class=" wp-image-10323 alignright" alt="maze2 300x300 4 Facts That Will Change How You Do Online Marketing  " src="http://blog.clicktale.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/maze2-300x300.png" width="240" height="240" title="4 Facts That Will Change How You Do Online Marketing  " /></a><em>Digital Customer Experience</em> is the ability to track, measure and explain how customers feel and interact with your online channels. If you&#8217;re able to explain why people stay or leave, what engages them and what frustrates them and what makes them purchase once or keep coming back for more &#8211; then you&#8217;re optimization effort will be that much more effective. And you&#8217;ll be in the right position to build a significant brand advantage over your competitors.</p>
<p>When discussing the ROI potential of Digital Customer Experience, nothing is more convincing than cold, hard data. So here are some research findings on the effectiveness of Digital Customer Experience and Website Optimization:</p>
<h2>1: Optimization Spend Directly Influences Conversion Rate</h2>
<p>- 39% of companies that allocate over a quarter of their marketing budget on optimization have conversion rates of above 5%.</p>
<p>- 58% of companies that allocate under a quarter of their marketing budget on optimization have conversion rates of less than 2%.</p>
<p><em>Adobe Research</em></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-10287" alt="optimization and conversion 4 Facts That Will Change How You Do Online Marketing  " src="http://blog.clicktale.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/optimization-and-conversion.jpg" width="615" height="225" title="4 Facts That Will Change How You Do Online Marketing  " /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Presented a different way &#8211; the table above from David Moth at Econsultancy shows that the higher the % of marketing budget spent on optimization &#8211; the higher the conversion rate.</p>
<h2>2: Session Replay Is More Effective than Statistics</h2>
<p><a href="http://blog.clicktale.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Session-Replay-2.png"><img class=" wp-image-10335  alignright" alt="Session Replay 2 4 Facts That Will Change How You Do Online Marketing  " src="http://blog.clicktale.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Session-Replay-2.png" width="320" height="356" title="4 Facts That Will Change How You Do Online Marketing  " /></a></p>
<p>- 57% of companies would consider digital customer experience (<a href="http://www.clicktale.com/products/mouse-tracking-suite/visitor-recordings" target="_blank">session replay</a>) as the most effective way of identifying problems or issues with online customer experience, compared with only 31% of companies that would consider Web Analytics as the most effective.</p>
<p><em>IBM Research<br />
</em></p>
<h2> 3. Companies Don&#8217;t Know Why People Leave their Website!</h2>
<p>- 93% of companies cannot quantify, or have only a vague idea of how much online revenue is lost through site abandonment due to poor digital customer experience.</p>
<p><em>IBM Research</em></p>
<h2>4. Companies Aren&#8217;t Getting Actionable Insights From Web Analytics</h2>
<p><a href="http://blog.clicktale.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/information.jpg"><img class="wp-image-10349 alignright" alt="information 4 Facts That Will Change How You Do Online Marketing  " src="http://blog.clicktale.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/information.jpg" width="441" height="261" title="4 Facts That Will Change How You Do Online Marketing  " /></a>- 96% of organizations have web analytics data. But 63% are not getting customer experience insights from it, or are getting them only occasionally.</p>
<p><em>Marketing Sherpa</em></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>From the above snippets of research we can create a clear argument in favor of placing Digital Customer Experience technology at the heart of the enterprise marketing effort:</p>
<p>- Too many companies don&#8217;t know enough about the vast majority of visitors that are leaving their websites.</p>
<p>- Web analytics, while essential, is not giving the answers or the insights into why visitors leave or why they have a negative online experience.</p>
<p>- Most companies understand that Digital Customer Experience technology is the correct way to identify those negative experiences and alleviate them.</p>
<p>- And finally, that the investment made in optimizing that experience is amply repaid through a direct improvement to the conversion rate (otherwise known as) the bottom line!</p>

" /></a>There is an ongoing debate as to what constitutes a &#8216;good&#8217; website conversion rate. As any marketer will know, conversion rates are the index of a website&#8217;s success and one of the primary KPI&#8217;s by which a marketing strategy is measured.</p>
<p>Many articles have been written on what exactly constitutes a good conversion rate. But the truth is that this varies according to many factors &#8211; not least, what industry you&#8217;re in. The lowest average conversion rates tend to be in e-commerce (around 1%), rising as we move into legal (2%), B2B (2.5%) and highest in finance/insurance (5%).</p>
<p>But these average figures can be deceptively low. In reality there is lots of room for maneuver between the median website performers and the very top website performers &#8211; by as much as <em>3-5 times</em>.</p>
<p>For a typical e-commerce site, website conversion rates can typically swing from below 1% to over 4% for the top performing sites. And if we consider that every single percentage point can be worth many millions in revenue to a large e-commerce business then even the numbers after the decimal point suddenly become hugely important to a business.</p>
<p>Now &#8211; your web analytics tools will tell you plenty about those that <em>do</em> convert. But what about the neglected masses that leave without a transaction? Do you know <em>why</em> they bounced? What if it&#8217;s due to a little-noticed customer experience problem that could be solved quite easily? But, if the problem is little noticed, then how will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span>, the marketing professional, know about it &#8211; unless you can see <em>into</em> your customer&#8217;s digital experience?</p>
<p>The infographic summarizes the predicament and the solution using ClickTale&#8217;s Digital Customer Experience software.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to <a href="https://econsultancy.com/blog/10066-understanding-online-customer-experience-four-key-trends#i.uptn5ses2cnguf" target="_blank">Graham Charlton</a> over at Econsultancy, companies with an online presence are focusing more and more on &#8216;why&#8217; customers behave or experience the web in the ways they do.</p>
<p>Marketers are increasingly using a variety of means to identify customer experience issues on their websites, including email, customer service calls, web analytics, online surveys and more.</p>
<p>But what&#8217;s interesting from the graph below is that while many companies are still on the adoption curve for Digital Customer Experience (DCX) technologies such as heatmaps and session replay (the last 2 bars in the chart), they do consider these technologies to be the <em>most effective at discovering and fixing online customer struggle</em> (57% for session replay and 40% for heatmaps).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.clicktale.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/customer-experience-econsultancy.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-10163" alt="customer experience econsultancy Is Cloud Bringing Digital Customer Experience Down to Earth?

" /></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Digital Customer Experience: SaaS vs On-Premise?</h3>
<p>So why would companies believe that heatmaps and session replay are among the best tools for understanding their online customers &#8211; and yet still be weak adopters? The answer could be related to the fact that this research was from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">two years ago</span> when the technology <em>was not seen as particularly accessible </em> - particularly in the high-end, enterprise market.</p>
<p>The good news is that all that has now changed. The rise of <em>SaaS-based solutions</em> <em>for the enteprise </em>now provide an alternative to project-heavy, on-premise solutions which, by their very nature, are considered to be their own worst enemy in terms of barriers to adoption.<em> </em><a href="http://www.clicktale.com/plans" target="_blank">ClickTale</a> is leading this transformation with enterprise DCX technology available from the Cloud. The company provides a range of data-rich heatmaps, high fidelity session replay and sophisticated reporting that enterprises can implement via an easy subscription.</p>
<p>The On-Premise vs SaaS debate has been a hot topic since way back at the start of the millennium when Cloud-based solutions first emerged. This article by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20140521094242-259880202-5-key-considerations-saas-vs-on-premise-software" target="_blank">Alex Hobbs</a> in Linkedin explains the pros and cons in detail &#8211; while this chart from the same article sums it up nicely for us:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.clicktale.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/on-premise-vs-SaaS.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-10165" alt="on premise vs SaaS Is Cloud Bringing Digital Customer Experience Down to Earth?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Conclusion &#8211; DCX Adoption Now Looking Up</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s probably a safe bet to say that the bar graph we presented at the top of this post will look radically different in the coming few years. Companies with an online business strategy, who appreciate the urgent need for Digital Customer Experience solutions including heatmaps and session replay, will now find the playing field far more amenable.</p>
<p>On-premise solutions are still out there for companies that really need them. But SaaS will continue to emerge as the dominant means of fast, hassle-free DCX technology adoption.</p>
