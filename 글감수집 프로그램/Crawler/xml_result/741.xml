				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have any interest in importing a vehicle into Australia, you have heard of the RAWS scheme before. In order to understand the RAWS scheme, you need a bit of a history lesson. The story starts in the 1980&#8242;s when the Full-Volume manufacturers wanted to reduce costs and managed to do so by reducing the range of cars they supplied.</p>
<p>The Japanese manufacturers were unable to justify the additional costs that came with modifying cars to meet the strict Australian Design Rules (ADRs). Australia was a relatively small market, meaning that it was not especially lucrative anymore. Soon European manufacturers felt the same way.</p>
<p><strong>The Low volume scheme begins</strong></p>
<p>There were some changes to the Motor Vehicle Standards, which was good for those car enthusiasts not happy with the choice offered on the Australian market. These amendments would allow individual importers to alter foreign cars to ensure that they complied with the ADRs. After these importers ensure that the cars were compliant with ADRs, they could supply the cars to the Australian market.</p>
<p>The first imports were primarily from the United States, but this shifted in the mid-1990&#8242;s. By then, the importers found that Japanese vehicles were far more interesting. These Japanese cars often had good maintenance history, often had low kilometres, tended to be more recent models due to strict registration laws, and were already right-hand drive. The additional features that these cars had were just another benefit. It did not take long before lots were filling up with Toyota, Mazda, and Nissan brands. Oftentimes at very competitive prices for the luxury car market.</p>
<p>The impact that these changes had were noticeable, and very quickly. There were just over a thousand cars were imported through the low volume scheme in 1993. By 2002, there were 16,000 for that year alone. The number of low-volume imports was still under 100,000.</p>
<p><strong>The RAWS scheme era</strong></p>
<p>On May 8th of 2003, a new chapter in the vehicle industry began with the introduction of the Specialist and Enthusiast Vehicle Scheme (SEVS). Since its introduction, the number of imports has slowed down. The reason that the RAWS scheme came about was that the low-volume import scheme had some loopholes.</p>
<p>Some importers began to take advantage of these loopholes, which resulted in a poor quality product for the consumer. SEVS ended these loopholes, meaning that rusted cars and damaged cars could no longer be imported for parts. It was now required by law to have all used imports be certified by a Registered Automotive Workshop (RAW). This was the introduction of the Registered Automotive Workshop Scheme.</p>
<p>For a vehicle to be eligible under SEVS, it needs to meet at least two of the four Specialist and Enthusiast criteria. It is also necessary that a RAW has documented evidence that suggests that the vehicle meets the requirements of the ADRs. A RAW is able to import upwards of 100 vehicles per annum.</p>
<p>While the SEVS scheme did increase the price of imports by a bit, it shows a commitment to a safer, higher quality product for the consumer.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Powerful machines that ensure your central heating systems works efficiently</p>
<p><strong>Image Source</strong>:<a href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8050/8099598183_e5f3e3f00c.jpg" target="_blank">https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8050/8099598183_e5f3e3f00c.jpg</a></p>
<p>Power flush machines are valuable tools that keep central heating systems in tip top condition and as such makes them more energy efficient. These great machines are designed to remove sludge, scale and any corrosion debris that may be present in a central heating system. Flushing out a system ensures no pipes ever get clogged up which could interrupt the flow. They are powerful machines that keep boilers in good condition ensuring they are de-scaled which makes them work at their optimum efficiency and again this means a lower energy bill and the peace of mind that your boiler&#8217;s lifespan would be prolonged.</p>
<p><strong>Is Your Boiler Noisy?</strong></p>
<p>If you find your boiler is much noisier than it usually is, there could be a build-up of scale and other debris which not only reduces its efficiency but makes it run hotter and noisier too. By having your central heating system power flushed, you eliminate this issue quickly and effectively and typically only one single purge is necessary to get the job done.</p>
<p><strong>How it Works</strong></p>
<p>Power flushing is a process by which heating systems are purged by forcing water through them at a high velocity but without pressure so that no actual damage occurs to the system during the process. By adding certain products the process becomes more effective with the end goal being to render a central heating system to its original state when new. This is achieved by forcing out sludge, corrosion debris and other deposits so the system runs at optimum efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>New Heating Systems Can Benefit Too</strong></p>
<p>Power flushing new central heating systems is an effective way of making sure there&#8217;s no excess flux, other debris or oil and grease which are used to prevent any components from rusting before the system is turned on. It&#8217;s also recommended for a system to be power flushed before a new boiler is fitted to an existing system. This is to prevent the risk of any boiler problems happening further down the line. Even if there isn&#8217;t a flow problem, many heating systems do have sludge and debris in them which affects their efficiency and puts extra pressure on boilers.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.trendtip.net/wp-content/uploads/power-flushing-machines.1jpg.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-139" src="http://www.trendtip.net/wp-content/uploads/power-flushing-machines.1jpg-282x300.jpg" alt="power flushing machines.1jpg" width="282" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a good idea to power flush heating systems before fitting a new boiler</p>
<p>Image Source: <a href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8260/8676578886_f810896e66.jpg" target="_blank">https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8260/8676578886_f810896e66.jpg</a></p>
<p><strong>Powerful Tools That Offer Versatility</strong></p>
<p>Power flushing machines are versatile and very easy to use which manufacturers recommend home owners use on a regular basis to keep their systems in tip top condition. By reducing pressure on your boiler, it reduces energy bills and naturally prolongs the lifespan of your boiler. Systems can be purged with the minimum amount of disruption and virtually no unnecessary dismantling making it a seamless and effective process all round.</p>
<p><strong>The Difference between Power Flushing Machines &amp; De-scaling Pumps</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a selection of power flushing machines on the market with some being more powerful than others. However, these machines should not be confused with de-scaling pumps which are a lot less powerful. A de-scaling pump would not be able to effectively purge a whole heating system because they just don&#8217;t boast the all-important flow rate and pressure that&#8217;s required to flush out the system.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Power flush machines are designed to purge heating systems with clean water and boast having the necessary return hoses, water and dump inlet hoses and valves needed to isolate whatever needs keeping out of the system. These machines also boast much higher temperature ratings and designed so that certain chemicals can be used to make the purge even more effective. It&#8217;s important to make sure you get the right type of <a href="http://www.fernox.com/equipment/powerflushing/powerflow+flushing+machine+mkiii" target="_blank">power flush</a> machine to suit the task it&#8217;s intended for so you know you are getting value on your investment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hiring the right model forklift for heavy duty applications is essential</p>
<p><strong>Image Source</strong>: <a href="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7347/12615445124_b2d8300b8c.jpg" target="_blank">https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7347/12615445124_b2d8300b8c.jpg</a></p>
<p>If you have a big project that involves heavy lifting you need to hire the right model forklift that boasts an adequate lifting capacity. There are a number of trucks out there which are more than capable of lifting loads that range from 8 tons right up to 48 tons. This type of vehicle offers much greater flexibility when it comes to heavy duty applications where a variety of options are required.</p>
<p><b>Hiring the Right Forklift is Essential</b></p>
<p>You need to know that a forklift you hire is capable of lifting the required weights because if you opt for a smaller vehicle, it could prove not only dangerous but a complete waste of time and money if the forklift is underpowered for the task in hand. Smaller forklifts are great in the right working environment, but for heavier applications, a more powerful industrial vehicle would be needed. The operator would also have to hold the necessary qualifications and skills to use such a powerful machine and it&#8217;s the employer who has to ensure this is the case.</p>
<p>There are however, certain other factors to take into account which includes the environment and the condition of the ground the forklift truck would be working on. On top of this other criteria to check out on a forklift includes engine power-outputs, masts, wheelbases and any other optional features which may be needed to complete the job safely and satisfactorily.</p>
<p><b>Requesting a Tailor Made Solution</b></p>
<p>By contacting a reputable and well established hire company, you have the peace of mind the vehicle will be in top condition before it arrives on-site. The company should also be able to <a href="http://www.amvargroup.com/fork-trucks/forklift-hire/" target="_blank">tailor a forklift to meet your specific hire needs</a> and this includes setting it up to be used in more challenging and demanding environments ensuring the forklift is a high-spec vehicle that would provide greater productivity as well as fast and safe handling.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.trendtip.net/wp-content/uploads/forklifting1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-130" alt="forklifting" src="http://www.trendtip.net/wp-content/uploads/forklifting1-300x203.jpg" width="300" height="203" /></a></p>
<p>Making sure the forklift you hire can cope with workloads is essential</p>
<p><strong>Image source:</strong> <a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/165/406275071_c2b99b6597.jpg" target="_blank">https://farm1.staticflickr.com/165/406275071_c2b99b6597.jpg</a></p>
<p><b>What to Look For in a Heavy Duty Forklift</b></p>
<p>If you are moving building materials which includes concrete and other heavy loads, you should make sure the forklift boasts a powerful industrial engine that can cope with extreme payloads. The truck should also offer all-round visibility to make the operator’s task much easier and to reduce any risk of an accident. Other factors to look for include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you need a short wheelbase model because the truck is to be used in an area where space is limited?</li>
<li>Are oil-immersed brakes fitted as standard and are the engine and transmission systems protected?</li>
<li>Does the forklift boast load-sensing hydraulics which offers the required power on demand and as such reduce fuel consumption?</li>
<li>Does the forklift boast a sturdy mast construction?</li>
<li>Are your staff fully qualified to operate such a powerful machine?</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>Hiring heavy duty forklifts for extreme applications does take a bit of planning. If you are in doubt as to what model you would need, by contacting a reputable hire company and discussing your needs with one of their experts, they would be able to advise on the right model industrial forklift to use for the applications you need to do.</p>
<p>However, it is up to you as the employer to ensure that all operators that drive these powerful machines whilst they are on-site are fully qualified to do so. The great thing about hiring industrial forklifts is that if you find the vehicle is not powerful enough, you should be able to discuss this with the hire company and have the vehicle replaced with a more powerful one to ensure the job is carried out safely and in an optimum time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you are preparing for a trade show for the first time ever or going into your 20<sup>th</sup> event this year, it is always important to set goals for your team.</p>
<p>Having a very clear cut expectation for how the trade show will go and what results will come of it will help to keep your team engaged and will drive more passion and enthusiasm on the trade show floor. Keep these things in mind when you are brainstorming trade show goals during the pre-show preparation period.</p>
<p><b>Why Set Goals for Your Exhibition?</b></p>
<p>The key reason for setting goals or targets for your exhibition is that it gives you and your exhibition staff a focus for their preparation pre-show and conduct and activity during the show and post show.</p>
<p>It provides a framework for all your exhibition preparation – it establishes your target audience, it helps you decide on the people you choose to staff the stand, the promotional products or services you offer, the methods you use to capture leads.</p>
<p>It affects the graphics you use on your display stand as well as how your team speak about or promote your business and services.</p>
<p><b>Remember the SMART Criteria</b></p>
<p>Make sure your criteria are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specific</li>
<li>Measurable</li>
<li>Achievable</li>
<li>Relevant</li>
<li>Time-based</li>
</ul>
<p>Specificity leads to clarity and means all your team will understand what they have to do.</p>
<p>Measurability means your team can track its progress and will have a clear idea of when it has achieved its goals. Remember to provide a way to record your results as you go.</p>
<p>Set goals that are challenging but achievable – this is not only about the size of the goal but also the nature of the goal – it must be something that the team is has the authority and tools to achieve.</p>
<p>Relevancy is about ensuring the teams&#8217; goals are consistent with company&#8217;s marketing objectives – for example serving 100 cups of complimentary coffee per day is a specific, measurable and achievable goal but is not that relevant to the company objectives (unless of course it is in the coffee business)</p>
<p>Setting a time frame around a goal is essential – as they say a goal without a deadline is a dream.</p>

<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Crystal is a long term investment.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Image source:</strong> <a href="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7143/6715428741_38bfec2ae2.jpg">https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7143/6715428741_38bfec2ae2.jpg</a></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">It’s hardly the end of the world when a bog-standard glass breaks, but when you bid farewell to a stunning piece of crystal you hoped to hold onto for life, it can be truly soul-destroying. The nature of family life is such that accidents can and will happen, which of course makes it impossible to rule out every eventuality – including an early grave for your fine crystal.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">The good news however is that with a little care and a touch of common sense, it’s perfectly possible to care for your investment in such a way as to minimise the likelihood of anything untoward happening. What’s important to realise is that it doesn’t take an unexpected drop or bump to ruin your crystal – even something as simple as improper cleaning or storage can take away its lustre for life.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here’s a look at a few simple tips on the subject of caring for crystal with the long-term in mind:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Careful Cleaning</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">So the most important thing of all to be aware of is what careful cleaning for crystal really means.</p>
<p dir="ltr">First and foremost, you should get out of the habit of relying on your dishwasher and get hands-on with caring for what matters to you. Now, this isn’t to say that there aren’t appliances and products alike that claim to be just the ticket for fine crystal, but the problem is that the moment you close the door and hit the power button, you relinquish control of what goes on. Will it come out in one piece? Will it be tarnished and cloudy? Really, why take the risk?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Instead, get into the habit of carrying out a simple manual wash of your crystal as soon as it has been used, using a hand washing product that’s certified as 100% safe for crystal. And if it doesn’t specifically state it is safe for crystal, it probably isn’t! Use only lukewarm water with a small amount of detergent and a non-abrasive cloth. When it comes to getting inside your glasses, invest in a special wand with a soft cloth on the end and never…EVER…force your hand into the thing, you might end up with an explosion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After this, rinse thoroughly with water of the same temperature and allow to drain for a few minutes before drying and polishing by hand. Leaving them to their own devices for too long will only end up creating water marks that are a pain to get rid of and could in some cases be permanent.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is the simple manual cleaning method that should be used for all of your <a href="http://www.brierleyhillcrystal.co.uk" target="_blank">British crystal</a> glassware – it takes a little effort but you’ll be glad you did so in a few decades when it still looks good as new.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Storage Tips</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">As for storage, you technically have two choices – do you want your crystal to be on display for all to see, or are you happy for it to be behind closed doors? As far as preservation goes, the simple advice is to make sure that all crystal is stored away somewhere that won’t be bombarded with dust, grease, damp and extreme changes in temperature. Left on a high shelf with no protection, it won’t be long until a thick skin of greasy grime builds up and good luck getting rid of that!</p>
<p dir="ltr">Behind the safety of a cupboard door is always a better idea, which in the case of those looking to show off their assets can be accomplished with nothing more extravagant than a simple glass display cabinet. But if you really do insist on keeping your crystal out in the open, be prepared to give it a good dust every day and a damp wipe every other.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Polish Up</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Last but not least, you can pick up all manner of specialist silver polishes these days that are designed not only to make your gear look great, but also preserve their lustre and to some extent prevent dust, dirt and grease from sticking to the surface. Even if you’re keeping your crystal locked away, it’s still a good idea to use some of this stuff from time to time as it will make a huge difference for its long-term looks.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img alt="https://farm7.staticflickr.com/6029/5888095966_3b8f4fc330.jpg" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/UxjKf7oWUEh0BdLxKuIwGle8__yKIqaNkQ1jrAPkgj8D_dS94g6ODDM73-mmVlGA4kgNu0GMHRrwVOKlu0fo6MmjjqsEixvhFWKkdu82Vrh5HgfFGtGfzLvTICx_jA2_FWvGkJwDMUk" width="333px;" height="500px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Keeping the glasses in good shape will help them last longer.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Additional:</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">And just to round off with a couple of auxiliary tips, if storing your crystal glasses on any kind of shelf, make sure you keep them well spaced out. Crystal is just brilliant at scratching and scuffing other crystal, so make sure they aren’t allowed to touch.</p>
<p dir="ltr">And finally, don’t ever handle crystal wine glasses by the stem when washing or drying them – there’s a pretty strong chance you’ll end up snapping them!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Going to the right exhibition is going to benefit your organization a great deal. You may be able to generate new leads, generate interesting new contacts with influential people, and you will be able to get your name out there. Choosing the wrong exhibition to attend is just going to waste your money. There is no one-stop list that works for everyone when it comes to finding the exhibition that works for you. This is why we have three important tips that help you choose the right exhibition for your company.</span></p>
<p><b>Make a list</b></p>
<p>The first thing you want to do is generate a list of possible exhibitions you could attend. This depends on your opportunities. How much of a budget do you have for each event, how far are you willing to travel to reach an exhibition? This all depends on your personal preferences.</p>
<p><b>Know your demographic before you plan</b></p>
<p>Chances are that you have a decent understanding of your demographic. If not, you should look into this before you ever book at a space at a convention or tradeshow. Remember that the average tradeshow’s attendee count is heavily padded with local residents. If those are not people that you are after, it might not be the right exhibition for you. Make sure that the people you are interested in meeting are actually going to be there.</p>
<p><b>Create your budget</b></p>
<p>Your promotion and marketing options are limited by your available budget. Just because you invest a great deal of money in a large booth does not necessarily mean that you are going to make a great deal of money. Sometimes less is more, especially if it means that you increase the value of the event for your business. Make sure that your display is easy to browse through, grabs the attention of the visitor, looks clean, and is well organized.</p>
<p><b>Research the specific show</b></p>
<p>You want to find out what a specific exhibition can do for your business. Start by looking at previous attendance reports. Has this been a show that has become increasingly popular or are they seeing dwindling numbers every year? If possible, talk to people who have been to the show before. Ask them about their overall satisfaction with the show. Perhaps they have valuable information for anyone who plants to participate in a particular exhibition.</p>
<p><strong>Author Bio: </strong>Looking to display something unique at your next trade show or exhibition.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A building project manager is in charge of the management and co-ordination of tasks at the project site.  It is a key role as ultimately he or she is responsible for the completion of the project on time and on budget.</p>
<p>A good building project manager needs to be aware and avoid these common mistakes.</p>
<p><b>Poor Planning</b></p>
<p>Before construction begins, a building project manager should communicate and allocate how the work will be carried out. Not doing this will cause a serious dent in both time and resources. Planning costs and estimates is another aspect that a project manager needs to be involved in, as also the drawing up of contracts between the main contractor and sub-contractors.</p>
<p><b>Indecision</b></p>
<p>The project manager may be called on to make critical decisions at short notice. It goes without saying that sometimes these may be hard decisions (a dismissal, a change in plans) and the project manager needs to be able to have the confidence to make these and manage the consequences.  Good communication and consistency are important.</p>
<p><b>Poor Conflict Resolution</b></p>
<p>The project manager is frequently called upon to umpire between the many parties involved at a project site. He should be capable of handling disputes fairly and as quickly as possible with the help of adequate technical information and deft personnel management skills. A thorough understanding of contracts drawn up among all the parties involved also helps a great deal.</p>
<p><b>Poor Risk Management</b></p>
<p>A project manager needs to be conversant with health and safety requirements. Good risk management not only means a safe work environment but also a greater chance of on-time completion – accidents and failures to meet local and federal regulations mean delays and extra costs.</p>
<p><b>Overspending</b></p>
<p><b></b>The project manager needs to keep an eye on the costs of the work and ensure that expenses are on track with estimates and be ready to intervene where necessary. This again comes down to good planning, regular monitoring and good and open communication among all the parties involved.</p>
