      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sir Bob Kerslake warns of more pain to come and says this will be hard to explain to staff hoping for some relief&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public sector spending cuts may continue for another five years whichever party is in government, the outgoing head of the civil service has said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sir Bob Kerslake, who stepped down as head of the home civil service as part of a Whitehall shake-up ordered by David Cameron in July, made the comments in a speech to the Institute for Government think-tank in which he reiterated the need for reform. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/26/public-sector-cuts-five-more-years-outgoing-civil-service-head-kerslake"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hosts crack sexist jokes about UAEs Major Mariam al-Mansouri, calling her boobs on the ground&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presenters on US cable channel Fox News cracked a series of sexist jokes after reporting that a female pilot from the UAE had taken part in a bombing mission of Isis targets in Syria, describing her as boobs on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One presenter, Kimberly Guilfoyle, tried to pay tribute to Major Mariam al-Mansouri, 35, one of four UAE fighter pilots to take part in the operation. Hey, Isis, you were bombed by a woman, she said. Very exciting, a woman doing this  I hope that hurt extra bad because in some Arab countries women cant even drive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/sep/25/fox-news-mock-female-pilot-isis-sexist-jokes"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Hassan Rouhani: Iranian help to tackle extremism hinges on nuclear deal</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/25/hassan-rouhani-iran-extremism-nuclear-deal</link>
      <description>Iranian president says regional powers should lead battle against Isis, as FBI says it has identified masked man in Isis videos&lt;p&gt;The Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, has said that if an agreement can be reached in the coming weeks on Irans nuclear programme it would clear the way for much greater Iranian cooperation with the west on combating the threat of Islamist extremism in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Rouhani told the UN general assembly that regional powers should lead the current battle against the Islamic State (Isis) in Syria and Iraq. Western meddling in the region had led to the rise of violent extremism in the first place, he said, and if outsiders wanted to help fight extremism now they should support Iranian leadership.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/25/hassan-rouhani-iran-extremism-nuclear-deal"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/25/tesco-finance-director-laurie-mcilwee-farewell-payoff</link>
      <description>Laurie McIlwee departed before £250m accounting crisis emerged, and sum will not be withheld as inquiry gathers pace&lt;p&gt;Tescos former finance director, Laurie McIlwee, is to receive a &amp;pound;1m payoff next week, even though the crisis-hit retailer is embroiled in a &amp;pound;250m accounting scandal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the investigation has only just got under way, McIlwee will be paid the cash as set out in his contract. He quit the business in April and was told to stay away from the office  a period when it appears the finances of the UKs largest retailer spun out of control.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/25/tesco-finance-director-laurie-mcilwee-farewell-payoff"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/25/fatah-hamas-palestinian-unity-government-gaza</link>
      <description>Breakthrough agreement negotiated in Cairo is designed to ease blockade and open way to reconstruction after Gaza war&lt;p&gt;The two main Palestinian factions, Fatah and Hamas, have reached a comprehensive agreement that would turn over the civil administration of Gaza immediately to officials of a Palestinian unity government led by President Mahmoud Abbas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement, negotiated in Cairo, is designed to ease the long blockade of Gaza by Israel and Egypt and open the way to reconstruction of the war-ravaged coastal entity. A recent Palestinian Authority study estimated the cost of reconstruction in Gaza following this summers 50-day conflict with Israel at $7.8bn (&amp;pound;4.8bn).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/25/fatah-hamas-palestinian-unity-government-gaza"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Kidnapped Nigerian student becomes first in months to escape Boko Haram</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/25/kidnapped-nigerian-schoolgirl-escape-boko-haram</link>
      <description>20-year-old in state of extreme trauma is receiving medical treatment after being found wandering through village&lt;p&gt;One of the school students snatched by Boko Haram when they raided a Nigerian dormitory has been found wandering through a small north-eastern village, the first confirmed escape since the atrocity that shocked the world in April this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the almost 300 girls and young women rounded up and carted away after Boko Haram stormed Chibok secondary school, a handful fled during the initial confusion. A relentless string of attacks in remote northern towns in Boko Harams stronghold of Borno state prompted a summit in Paris that led to a renewed military push from Nigeria, neighbours Chad, Cameroon and Niger, and western allies including the US and the UK. But five months on, 276 of the girls remain in captivity and abductions continue to be used as a strategy by the extremists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/25/kidnapped-nigerian-schoolgirl-escape-boko-haram"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>Gregorio de Falco was praised for ordering stricken ships captain, Francesco Schettino, to get back on board&lt;p&gt;He was the Italian hero to Francesco Schettinos villain: a coastguard official who, in the days after the Costa Concordia disaster, became a symbol of responsibility in nation that was &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/17/costa-concordia-coastguard-captain-call"&gt;horrified by the allegedly reckless behaviour of the cruise ships captain&lt;/a&gt;. On Thursday Italians were yet again engaged in a collective frenzy over straight-talking Gregorio de Falco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 50-year-old has said he is being transferred out of operational service at the Livorno coastguard and into administrative duties, prompting anger among those who remember his bracing words to Schettino on the night of the tragedy and despair over a country that they say does not know how to treat its heroes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/25/costa-concordia-hero-coastguard-gregorio-de-falco-italy"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Indonesian parliament scraps direct elections, undermining Joko Widodo</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/26/indonesian-parliament-scraps-direct-elections-undermining-joko-widodo</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Vote backed by Prabowo, who was defeated by Widodo in presidential election, takes electoral system back to Suharto era&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indonesias outgoing parliament voted on Friday to scrap direct elections for local officials and return to the electoral system in place under the former dictator Suharto, in what was widely regarded as a setback to the countrys democracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vote represents an early defeat for president-elect Joko Widodo, whose party had voted against the change, and suggests he will face a struggle to govern effectively. The bill was supported by a coalition of rightwing parties whose candidate, Prabowo Subianto, a Suharto-era general, was narrowly defeated in Julys presidential elections. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/26/indonesian-parliament-scraps-direct-elections-undermining-joko-widodo"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>Banknote maker issues second profit warning in a year and cuts dividend as chairman blames overcapacity in the market&lt;p&gt;Banknote maker De La Rue has warned on profits and slashed its half-year dividend after fierce competition cut the prices it charges for printing banknotes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, which this month &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/08/de-la-rue-seals-deal-plastic-uk-banknotes" title=""&gt;won the contract to print the new plastic Bank of England notes&lt;/a&gt;, said annual profit would be about &amp;pound;20m lower than last year. It cut its interim dividend to 8.3p a share from 14.1p and said it would review the full-year payout next year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/26/de-la-rue-shares-plunge-profit-warning"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Court rejects call for womans jail term over false rape claims to be increased</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/sep/25/court-rejects-solicitor-general-rhiannon-brooker-jail-term-false-rape-claims</link>
      <description>Solicitor general, Robert Buckland QC, said sentence of Rhiannon Brooker was unduly lenient, but court of appeal disagrees&lt;p&gt;The solicitor general has been criticised for asking a court to increase a three-and-a-half-year jail term imposed on a trainee barrister and new mother convicted of falsely accusing her former boyfriend of a series of rapes and assaults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Buckland QC asked the court of appeal to increase the sentence handed to Rhiannon Brooker, 30, after &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jun/05/law-graduate-guilty-falsely-accusing-boyfriend-rape" title=""&gt;she was found guilty of fabricating allegations&lt;/a&gt; that led to her ex-partner Paul Fensome being jailed for 36 days. But three appeal court judges ruled that the term should not be increased.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/sep/25/court-rejects-solicitor-general-rhiannon-brooker-jail-term-false-rape-claims"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/25/minimum-wage-unite-boost-economy-jobs-uk</link>
      <description>Britains biggest trade union says increasing hourly rate by £1.50 to £7.81 would generate billions in revenues&lt;p&gt;The minimum wage should be increased immediately to &amp;pound;7.81 an hour, Britains biggest trade union has said, arguing it would boost the economy as well as lift millions of low paid workers out of poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unite said a &amp;pound;1.50 increase from the current hourly rate of &amp;pound;6.31 was affordable because it would generate an estimated &amp;pound;2.1bn in revenues for the public purse and create at least 30,000 jobs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/25/minimum-wage-unite-boost-economy-jobs-uk"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;President says world cannot expect US to combat the virus alone, and expresses frustration at inaction from other countries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barack Obama warned the world on Thursday not to stand back and expect the United States to combat the spread of the Ebola virus alone, saying a slow international response could cost hundreds of thousands of lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking at a special high-level meeting on Ebola at the United Nations, Obama said there had been progress in efforts to slow the disease at its epicentre in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. But he added: We need to be honest with ourselves. Were not moving fast enough. Theres still a significant gap between where we are and where we need to be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/25/obama-un-ebola-virus-spread-outbreak"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>Jewellery makers claim against internet service providers raises concern among freedom of speech campaigners&lt;p&gt;Cartier International, the luxury watch and jewellery company, is attempting to block websites allegedly selling counterfeit goods in a test case that could have far-reaching consequences for the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the Paris-based company launched their claim at the high court in London on Thursday. It is believed to be the first time online service providers have been asked to close down websites on the grounds that they feature pirated trademark logos.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/25/cartier-legal-attempt-block-websites-counterfeit-goods"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

On 5, its Spieth turn not to hit one, his nervous birdie putt dying right of the cup. His miss gives Poulter the chance to knock in his par putt from six feet for a half, and its not one hes of a mind to turn down. Poulter was all over the place at the start, but hes stopped Spieth winning the last two holes with some stubborn golf. Thats exactly what Paul McGinley will want to see. Hes been very impressive in a match-play sense, if not in terms of quality golf. A lot of nervous play right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 UP Rose/Stenson v Watson/Simpson (7)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 UP Bjorn/Kaymer v Fowler/Walker (6)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gallacher/Poulter v Spieth/Reed 1 UP (5)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 UP Garc&amp;iacute;a/McIlroy v Bradley/Mickelson (4)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-09-26T09:34:18.698+01:00"&gt;9.34am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rose lifts a sand wedge to five feet on 7.&lt;/strong&gt; He has been simply wonderful so far today. Watson and Simpson havent done too much wrong, and yet theyre two down, facing a three-hole deficit. On 5, Gallacher sends his second near that hazard front right of the hole. He might be in that, game over. What a mess hes made of this hole. Poulter knocks his second into the heart of the green, but quite a way from the hole. Advantage Spieth and Reed here, with both on the green and Spieth pin high, 15 feet from the flag. And on 6, Kaymer hits a dreadful birdie putt to throw away the chance of going 3up. Lucky he didnt give up on his stroke like that on the 18th at Medinah, huh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 UP Rose/Stenson v Watson/Simpson (6)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 UP Bjorn/Kaymer v Fowler/Walker (6)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gallacher/Poulter v Spieth/Reed 1 UP (4)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 UP Garc&amp;iacute;a/McIlroy v Bradley/Mickelson (4)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-09-26T09:29:02.744+01:00"&gt;9.29am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super Sergio Garcia!&lt;/strong&gt; Hes found the bunker to the left of the long par-three 4th. And what an escape! He blasts out, the ball dropping just before the downslope in the middle of the green, and rolling straight into the cup from 40 feet! Always going in! Mind you, if it wasnt dead on line, it was racing a fair old way past the flag. Mickelson, true to form, nearly chips in from a tight lie to the right of the green for a half, but not quite. Brilliant effort, though. More good news for Europe on 6, where Kaymer caresses his tee shot to eight feet, though on 5 Gallacher sends a massive slice into nonsense down the right. Hes going to get a free drop, but hes got trees and a water hazard to cross, hitting blind. This holess up to Poulter, one would have thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 UP Rose/Stenson v Watson/Simpson (6)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 UP Bjorn/Kaymer v Fowler/Walker (5)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gallacher/Poulter v Spieth/Reed 1 UP (4)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 UP Garc&amp;iacute;a/McIlroy v Bradley/Mickelson (4)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-09-26T09:23:22.195+01:00"&gt;9.23am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rose sends his tee shot at 6, Mickle Skelp, over the flag.&lt;/strong&gt; Hell have a 30-footer for birdie from the back of the green. Stensons is superb, half the distance inside. Watson and Simpson join Rose at the back. Theyll not be making their birdie putts, but neither does Stenson, missing a decent chance to put some distance between Europe and the Americans in that match. On 5, the second group are making a better fist of the hole, Crookit Cratur. Kaymer finds the heart of the green, while Fowler is pin high, and brilliantly so. Kaymer cant make his birdie putt, but Fowler can, rolling in a right-to-left breaker from the edge of the green, 15 feet from the hole! Thats outstanding golf from Fowler. Theyre back in the match, 2down, with a birdie on the hardest hole! On 3, Bradley wedges his third shot stone dead. Thats par, likely to save the day unless McIlroy can roll one in from distance. Which he cant. Brilliant from Bradley, and McIlroy shows his frustration. And on 4, Poulter cant knock in his birdie putt, but neither can Spieth, who misses abysmally from six feet. Poulter applied the pressure on the young man there. Hes back!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 UP Rose/Stenson v Watson/Simpson (6)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 UP Bjorn/Kaymer v Fowler/Walker (5)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gallacher/Poulter v Spieth/Reed 1 UP (4)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Garc&amp;iacute;a/McIlroy A/S Bradley/Mickelson (3)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-09-26T09:13:19.777+01:00"&gt;9.13am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Komik kutz on 5, the hardest hole on the course, where Rose nearly finds the 6th tee with a wayward drive, Simpson finds the hazard front right of the green, and Bubba plugs his ball in a bunker. &lt;/strong&gt;Stenson has a 20-footer to win with par (!) but yet again he doesnt hit his putt, and thats a half with a pair of bogeys. Spieths tee shot at 4 is in Rose-Kaymer Country, another chance for the Americans to turn up the heat on Gallacher and Poulter. But Poults caresses a hybrid to ten feet himself. Hes outside Spieth, but thats turned the hole into a shootout on the green. Meanwhile on 3, the Americans are in a spot of bother, with Bradley short in two and Mickelson over a cart path on the right. McIlroy meanwhile finds the heart of the green with his second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-09-26T09:06:37.229+01:00"&gt;9.06am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sheer brilliance from Martin Kaymer! &lt;/strong&gt;From 15 feet, after that glorious tee shot at the monster par-three 4th, he rolls a confident birdie putt into the cup, the ball curling in beautifully from the right! Europe are 3up! Kaymer modestly punches the air and smiles a very content smile. And will the real Ian Poulter please stand up? Oh hes stood up, as you always knew he would! Eventually. He knocks in a very missable ten-footer on 3 to halve the hole. Eyes not quite bulging yet in the trademark style, but he strides off with determination. Thats a pleasing sight for Europe. This pairing are hanging on here after a shaky start; will Poulters magical saver turn the tide?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 UP Rose/Stenson v Watson/Simpson (4)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;3 UP Bjorn/Kaymer v Fowler/Walker (4)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gallacher/Poulter v Spieth/Reed 1 UP (3)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Garc&amp;iacute;a/McIlroy A/S Bradley/Mickelson (2)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-09-26T08:59:40.505+01:00"&gt;8.59am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neither McIlroy nor Garcia make a particularly good fist of going close with their third shots at 2 from short distance.&lt;/strong&gt; Fairly ordinary pars, leaving the door open for Bradley to nick the hole. Hes got an uphill 15-footer for an unlikely win, but the birdie effort slides by, never going in. Poor stuff from all four players there in the morning marquee match. Up on 4, Kaymer cant quite replicate Roses stunning tee shot of earlier, but hes not far off, and in the box seat. A chance for Europe to take a serious early stranglehold on that match.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 UP Rose/Stenson v Watson/Simpson (4)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 UP Bjorn/Kaymer v Fowler/Walker (3)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gallacher/Poulter v Spieth/Reed 1 UP (2)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Garc&amp;iacute;a/McIlroy A/S Bradley/Mickelson (2)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-09-26T08:53:28.373+01:00"&gt;8.53am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The suns out over Gleneagles. &lt;/strong&gt;As a popular US indie popster once trilled, god damn right its a beautiful day. Thank the lord, then, that weve got our top snapper Tom Jenkins out on the course, capturing the moment for you. &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2014/sep/26/ryder-cup-2014-scenic-gleneagles-in-pictures"&gt;Mr Js beautiful photographs, right here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-09-26T08:49:19.339+01:00"&gt;8.49am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not a single player in the final match has found the fairway with their drive on the par-five 2nd. &lt;/strong&gt;Sergio lays up. Mickelson wangs one into more rough down the right. Bradleys in a deep bunker and can only take his medicine. Rory joins Sergio near the front of the green. Advantage Europe on this hole right now. Up on 4, Rose rattles in his birdie putt! That was the least his superlative tee shot deserved. Europes opening pairing are now 2up. And their second paring are still 2up too, with Bjorn knocking in a 12-footer for a half. Its a strong start for Europe, though the two American rookies Spieth and Reed look to have rattled Ian Poulter, who has been very shaky so far, and can thank his debutant partner Stephen Gallacher for ensuring the pair arent further adrift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 UP Rose/Stenson v Watson/Simpson (4)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 UP Bjorn/Kaymer v Fowler/Walker (3)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gallacher/Poulter v Spieth/Reed 1 UP (2)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Garc&amp;iacute;a/McIlroy A/S Bradley/Mickelson (1)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-09-26T08:42:54.705+01:00"&gt;8.42am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Justin Rose has creamed a 4-iron into the heart of the long, uphill par-three 4th. &lt;/strong&gt;He uses the ridge in the middle of the green to send his ball rolling back towards the pin. Hes got an eight-footer for birdie. A par might even be enough, as neither Watson nor Simpson can find the putting surface. Meanwhile theres a settler for Gallacher on 2, who finds the par-five green in two strokes, though his eagle putt is a bit timid. With Poulter having fannied around in a bunker, only just getting his ball out of the sand and into the fringe, then duffing his chip, its all down to the debutant here. Especially now that Patrick Reed has rolled in from the fringe himself for birdie. But Gallachers up to the task, knocking in the five footer he left himself to half the hole in four!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 UP Rose/Stenson v Watson/Simpson (3)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 UP Bjorn/Kaymer v Fowler/Walker (2)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gallacher/Poulter v Spieth/Reed 1 UP (2)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Garc&amp;iacute;a/McIlroy A/S Bradley/Mickelson (1)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-09-26T08:37:13.323+01:00"&gt;8.37am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bubba has a chance for birdie at 3 after a delicious pin-high approach. &lt;/strong&gt;Hes 12 feet from the hole, but his ball stays out to the left, and the States are still down in that match. A birdie for Bjorn at the par-five 2nd, and thats a perfect start for Europe in the second match! Theyre 2up. Europe are under pressure a little on 1, though, as Mickelson clips a gorgeous approach to three feet, if that. Hell surely be given that for his birdie. Yep. Rory does his best to keep the pressure on, by wedging to 12 feet - and he rolls in the birdie putt to save Europe! He punches the air in delight. The crowd erupt. A half that feels like a win. Thatll hurt Mickelson after such a wonderful second shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 UP Rose/Stenson v Watson/Simpson (3)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 UP Bjorn/Kaymer v Fowler/Walker (2)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gallacher/Poulter v Spieth/Reed 1 UP (1)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Garc&amp;iacute;a/McIlroy A/S Bradley/Mickelson (1)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-09-26T08:30:17.412+01:00"&gt;8.30am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up on the 1st green, Speith cant make his birdie putt. &lt;/strong&gt;That gives Poulter, who has splashed out from the bunker to three feet, a chance to halve the hole. But he misses the tiddler, as it lips out on the right. He bends down to throw his ball away in disgust, but cant even manage that properly, the dappled orb slipping through his fingers before he finally bats it out of his sight. Hes sick. And after all that pre-match big talk, a tad embarrassed Ill be bound. Hes plenty of time left to make good on his promises. But thats not a good start by Mr 80%, and its the first splash of red on the board for the USA at the 2014 Ryder Cup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 UP Rose/Stenson v Watson/Simpson (2)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 UP Bjorn/Kaymer v Fowler/Walker (1)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gallacher/Poulter v Spieth/Reed 1 UP (1)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Garc&amp;iacute;a/McIlroy v Bradley/Mickelson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-09-26T08:24:28.429+01:00"&gt;8.24am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Europe are struggling on 1, though. &lt;/strong&gt;Poulters second shot is always heading right, and it flops into the bunker front right of the green. Spieth, from the centre of the fairway, finds the centre of the green. Hell have a fairly straight putt across the green from 12 feet, maybe a little left-to-right. Back up on the tee, the crowd burst into a chant about Rory McIlroy, set to the tune of Chirpy Chirpy Cheep Cheep by Scottish pop sensations Middle Of The Road. Ah the early 1970s, McIlroy will be able to tap into that. First up in this match, Keegan Bradley, who pushes one miles to the right. Thats a far from ideal angle to be approaching the green from, never mind the fact hes in thick rough. Phil Mickelson finds the fairway, but its not the longest tee shot. Sergios next up! The Ryder Cup stalwart gets out the big stick, and blooters it into the first cut down the left. Not brilliant, but hes got an inviting route into the green. Finally its Rory. And when hes hot with the driver, hes hot. Thats gone miles down the middle. OK, thats everyone out this morning, then, the first-tee nonsense over with. Lets see how this pans out, then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-09-26T08:15:38.201+01:00"&gt;8.15am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Back on the tee, the third match tees off.&lt;/strong&gt; Reed guides a careful 3-wood down the fairway. Not long, but on the short stuff. Spieth is a little longer, in very good nick. Gallacher, saltire running down the right-hand portion of his sweater, hits a nightmare first shot, his ball ending right up in the face of a bunker down the right. Its all up to Poulter on this hole, then. His gameface suddenly on, he batters a drive into the first cut down the left. Not ideal, but hell have a good route coming into the green if nothing else. Up on the short-ish par-five 2nd, Rose is left with a 40-foot birdie putt up a ridge. Once again, hes a drop of energy short of making it. Par, though with the other three players in the match within 12 feet, that probably wont be enough. Simpsons birdie putt is poor, never in from the moment it left his putter. Hes started sluggishly. Bubba is four feet from the hole, so Stenson will have to knock his 10-footer for birdie. Which he does, always going in. And Bubbas putt turns away to the right! He stares, mouth agape, at his caddy, in total shock. That was awful! Stensons won the hole with a birdie! Early days, to such an extent that this observation is pointless, but Europe are ahead in the first two matches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 UP Rose/Stenson v Watson/Simpson (2)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 UP Bjorn/Kaymer v Fowler/Walker (1)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gallacher/Poulter v Spieth/Reed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-09-26T08:06:58.102+01:00"&gt;8.06am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First blood to Europe! &lt;/strong&gt;Fowler and Walker concede Kaymers tiddler, which means Walker needs to knock in his 12-footer to halve the hole with a birdie. He cant make it, the ball sliding by to the right, kinking off just before it reaches the hole. A long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rose/Stenson A/S Watson/Simpson (1)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 UP Bjorn/Kaymer v Fowler/Walker (1)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-09-26T08:02:52.749+01:00"&gt;8.02am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theres only one Ian Poulter, one Ian Poulter, walking along, singing this song, walking in a Poulter wonderland. &lt;/strong&gt;Yes, its that time. I wonder what the shy, retiring Stephen Gallacher makes of all this? Never mind poor Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed. But enough of the nonsense on the first tee: down the fairway, Martin Kaymer has nearly holed his wedge! What an extraordinary shot! It pitched to the right of the hole, bounced a couple of inches behind it, then span back to the left! A full 360-degree tour! Hell be left with an easy birdie chance from three feet. Walker, with his team-mate Fowler in the bunker to the front right of the green, gives himself a chance of a three with a pin-high wedge to 15 feet. Thats a decent response in the circumstances. Do you think European vice captain Miguel &amp;Aacute;ngel Jim&amp;eacute;nez will be downing rioja next to McGinleys Guinness on Sunday? wonders Gareth Noonan. Well, only a fool would try to predict the outcome of a Ryder Cup with any confidence. But I do think Jim&amp;eacute;nez will be downing rioja on Sunday evening, yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-09-26T07:55:50.796+01:00"&gt;7.55am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The crowd at the first tee are cheering every practice swing. &lt;/strong&gt;Hooray! Ol&amp;eacute;! That must begin to grate. It &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; get old quite quickly. This is match number two, trumpets Ivor Robson. Representing the United States of America, Rickie Fowler and Jimmy Walker. The polite clapping. Representing Europe, Thomas Bjorn and Martin Kaymer. Rah rah rah. Fowler is up first, and he hoicks his drive in Bubba Country down the left. Walker is more accurate, his first shot in Ryder Cup competition, hit as a 37-year-old, straight and long. Bjorn, fully bearded and with a determined look in his eye, finds the fairway safely, if not with much distance. Kaymer is up last, and the first Ryder Cup shot he hits since making the putt that secured the trophy in Medinah finds the left-hand side of the fairway. A good start from the tee for Europe. Up on the green, a little heartache, though. Bubba makes his par, leaving Rose with a fairly straight uphill 10-footer for the hole. But he doesnt hit it. Dead on line, but it needs an extra joule of energy. A solid hole, but honours even.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rose/Stenson A/S Watson/Simpson (1)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bjorn/Kaymer v Fowler/Walker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-09-26T07:47:58.851+01:00"&gt;7.47am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rory McIlroy has just been asked about the ligitation jibe made by Phil Mickelson in the phoney war ahead of the action. &lt;/strong&gt;He smiled, but there was a detectable frost forming around the teeth. Does that have an effect? Of course it does, he said. Not quite a seethe, but not far off it. Gauntlets are down! Bjorn and Kaymer take to the first tee, with all the brouhaha that entails. Up the hole, Bubba finds the centre of the green with his second, but only the front portion with a ridge between his ball and the hole. Rose wedges to 12 feet, though. This is a fine start by Europe. Speaking of starts, Simpson just about makes the front of the green with his long second shot, a real face-saver after that hellish opening tee shot. He can also take heart that his opener wasnt any worse than Graeme McDowells at Medinah - G-Mac nearly clattered his into a wall - and look what happened to Europe there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-09-26T07:41:50.834+01:00"&gt;7.41am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OK, then, ladies and gentlemen. The waiting is nearly over, because its on! &lt;/strong&gt;To screams of ol&amp;eacute;, ol&amp;eacute;, ol&amp;eacute; and Europe, Europe, Europe!, Justin Rose, Henrik Stenson, Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson make their way to the tee. Bedlam. But as the captains Paul McGinley and Tom Watson offer each other best wishes, and then chat to their players, a silence descends as the nerves kick in. This is really happening. The legendary Open starter Ivor Robson picks up his microphone, and welcomes the gallery to the first days play. This is match number one. Representing the United States of America ... Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson! Plenty of polite, warm applause. Representing Europe, Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson. Bedlam, bedlam, bedlam, Europe, Europe, Europe. The United States have the honour in all matches. On the tee... Bubba Watson. Sure enough, Webb Simpson steps forward, to great laughter. Its going to be Webb Simpson, ahems Robson. Simpson steps up, and a terrible short 3-wood, off the top of the club, only just reaches the fairway. Oh dear. Bubba, having encouraged the crowd to scream as he tees off, with a nod and a broad smile, whistles his drive into the thick stuff down the left. Not an ideal start for the Americans. Then Rose steps up. Absolute silence as he splits the fairway with as good an opening shot as he could have hoped for. Poor old Stenson is last up. What a wait. But hes down the middle too. His 3-wood outstrips Simpsons by a good 100 yards! Advantage Europe, but theres oh such a long, long road to travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-09-26T07:31:38.520+01:00"&gt;7.31am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul McGinley is out on the first tee, and hes whipping up a storm. &lt;/strong&gt;The crowd are eating out of his hand. On Sky, Colin Montgomerie makes the very good point that from the second shot on, this is a golf match. The first shot? Thats not a golf match. Thats theatre. None of these players will have experienced this before, not in front of this many people. Nervous yet? Imagine how Bubba Watson, Webb Simpson, Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson are feeling! Ian Poulter, playing in the third game with the debutant and home favourite Stephen Gallacher, is nonchalantly chewing gum. Its going to be amazing, he smiles. Scotland, Stevie G, Gleneagles, were wearing the colours, its going to be absolutely sensational. I cant wait to get through the tunnel, give Seve a little wink, and get out on the golf course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-09-26T07:25:57.958+01:00"&gt;7.25am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Justin Rose is out in the first match, and hes feeling good despite the pressure that brings.&lt;/strong&gt; We feel confident and strong going into today. Each man is up for it. Its all about getting a good start and playing as hard as you can. Also feeling fine, you can be sure of it, is the marvellous Rickie Fowler, wholl be contesting the second match this morning. No word from him today as such, but if this passionate statement of intent wasnt enough ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-09-26T07:15:01.587+01:00"&gt;7.15am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Its a beautiful morning in Perthshire. &lt;/strong&gt;Its &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; a beautiful morning in Perthshire. Theres been overnight rain, and though its dry now, the PGA Centenary Course at Gleneagles will be playing long - even longer - as a result. As expected, the winds up, at 20mph. Thats no small concern, as accuracy is essential with the rough penal. Theres already a huge crowd at the first tee awaiting the opening matches. The fans have been there for over an hour. And theres you thinking its early, drinking your mug of breakfast tea, hunched over the computer in the warm. These brave souls have already been on the shuttle buses and through security. I doubt half of them bothered to go to bed! What an atmosphere at Gleneagles! The 2014 Ryder Cup is nearly with us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-09-26T07:05:42.969+01:00"&gt;7.05am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are the pairings for the Friday morning fourballs, as announced last night at the Opening Ceremony by Paul McGinley and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tom Watson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7.35 am BST:&lt;/strong&gt; Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson v Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7.50 am:&lt;/strong&gt; Thomas Bjorn and Martin Kaymer v Rickie Fowler and Jimmy Walker&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.05 am:&lt;/strong&gt; Stephen Gallacher and Ian Poulter v Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.20 am:&lt;/strong&gt; Sergio Garc&amp;iacute;a and Rory McIlroy v Keegan Bradley and Phil Mickelson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="block-time published-time"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2014-09-26T07:00:04.577+01:00"&gt;7.00am &lt;span class="timezone"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So ... how on earth do you follow &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt; How do you follow the Miracle of Medinah, one of the most astonishing performances in the history of All Sport, which saw 12 European heroes overturning a seemingly unassailable lead built up by a brilliant USA team, every man operated by strings, levers and pulleys from the heavens, by Seve.

      <description>&lt;p&gt; Yorkshire vowed to defend captain Gale against charges&lt;br&gt; Ashwell Prince says Gales use of Kolpak term wasnt racist&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/18/andrew-gale-yorkshire-charges-racism"&gt; Gale puts racism charges to one side&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Gale is expected to be cleared of allegations of racism without even a formal hearing by the England and Wales Cricket Board. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Yorkshire captain last week became the first player to be charged with racist language under county crickets disciplinary code following a clash with Lancashires Ashwell Prince during the recent Roses match at Old Trafford. But having accepted an initial punishment of a two-match suspension for abusive language, Yorkshire made it clear that they would be defending him against any further charges  and Prince then told a South African radio station that he did not regard Gales use of the word Kolpak as racist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/25/yorkshire-andrew-gale-cleared-racism-allegations"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>Dutchman hampered by 10 unavailable players&lt;br /&gt; United have five points from five league games&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/25/louis-van-gaal-manchester-united-paddy-mcnair-defensive-crisis" title=""&gt; Van Gaal may call on novice McNair in defence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/25/manchester-united-fans-come-home-ronaldo-banner-real-madrid" title=""&gt; United fans to fly Come Home Ronaldo banner at Real game&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Louis van Gaal has admitted Manchester Uniteds plight is the hardest moment of a glittering managerial career. United have only five points from five Premier League games and have won only once, with their last outing the &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/21/leicester-city-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report" title=""&gt;5-3 defeat at Leicester City &lt;/a&gt;where they conceded four unanswered second half goals in 21 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Van Gaal has nine players injured and a further one unavailable in Tyler Blackett who is suspended. He has a crisis at centre-back because Chris Smalling is injured along with Phil Jones and Jonny Evans. And as Blackett is also unavailable as a left-sided player in the position, Van Gaal confirmed he will have to &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/25/louis-van-gaal-manchester-united-paddy-mcnair-defensive-crisis" title=""&gt;turn to the under-21 squad&lt;/a&gt; for replacements for the home game against West Ham on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/25/louis-van-gaal-manchester-united-hardest-challenge"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Warrington inspired by Stefan Ratchford to end Castlefords fairytale</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/25/castleford-warrington-super-league-match-report</link>
      <description>Castleford 14-30 Warrington&lt;br /&gt; Wolves likely to face Wigan in semi-finals&lt;p&gt;The class of Stefan Ratchford, again showing the threat he can offer from any position in the backline, broke open a tight elimination play-off to take Warrington within 80 minutes of a third consecutive Grand Final appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ratchford, who switched to full-back after Matty Russell was injured in Warringtons first-round play-off win against Widnes, laid on tries for Gareth OBrien and Rhys Evans in the space of four minutes midway through the second half to kill off a spirited Castleford comeback as the Tigers battled in vain to keep their memorable season alive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/25/castleford-warrington-super-league-match-report"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Ryder Cup 2014: How players and punters should behave at Gleneagles</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/sep/25/ryder-cup-2014-gleneagles-etiquette-guide</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;From not jigging on the 17th green to keeping military fatigues out of sight, the etiquette rules for everyone to follow&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2014/sep/25/ryder-cup-2014-gleneagles-fly-through-front-nine-video"&gt;Animated fly-through of Gleneagles course&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ryder Cup has, since its inception in 1927, been contested by four different teams: Great Britain, Great Britain and Ireland, Europe, and of course the United States of America. A strange hodgepodge of countries, kingdoms, continents and federal republics  the USA alone is made up of 50 independently functioning sections, much like Jim Furyks backswing  and yet despite their disparate cultural make-ups, theres been no doubting the passion these teams have generated over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But sometimes this passion boils over into unacceptable confrontations or, depending on how you see them, highly amusing childish fiascos. Either way, all best avoided. So to swerve any unnecessary unpleasantness this upcoming week - which, for the record, will see the debut of another new team in what appears to be some sort of sun-drenched collective from Texas, Florida &amp;amp; California  weve cobbled together a simple etiquette guide designed to guarantee a weekend of adult, stramash-free golf at Gleneagles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/sep/25/ryder-cup-2014-gleneagles-etiquette-guide"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Viral video chart: Emma Watson, the iPhone 6 and an anaconda</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/sep/26/emma-watson-iphone-6-harry-potter-viral-video-chart</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Harry Potter star talks feminism, an Australian drops his iPhone and a 17ft anaconda is caught on camera&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the week that Emma Watson threw off her wizards cloak, put down her wand and took to the podium for the launch of the UNs HeforShe campaign. The actors &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0Dg226G2Z8"&gt;speech on gender equality and feminism&lt;/a&gt;, in her role as UN goodwill ambassador, attracted widespread support  and inevitable vicious trolling  on social media. There are various recordings of the speech on YouTube, many of them with millions of views. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/sep/26/emma-watson-iphone-6-harry-potter-viral-video-chart"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Marvellous; Your Home in their Hands review  two Neil Baldwins meet real Lou Macari and real Gary Lineker</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/sep/26/marvellous-neil-baldwin-toby-jones-peter-bowker-film</link>
      <description>Toby Jones gives a lovely, very human, performance in Peter Bowkers film of Neil Baldwins life story. If this film were a body part, it would be a heart, and a big one&lt;p&gt;I wonder if Ricky Gervais saw &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/sep/21/toby-jones-marvellous-neil-baldwin"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marvellous&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (BBC2). The creator of Derek might have learned something from Toby Jones. You dont need to ham it up, dart your eyes all over the place, hang your head to one side and your mouth open. Sometimes less is more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I suppose it helps Jones that the person he is playing - Neil Baldwin - is a real one, and around, and he has a life model to work with. Hes not just around, but sometimes he is on screen with him, too. Yes, the real Neil Baldwin joins the pretend Neil Baldwin in his own story  like here, sitting together on a bench outside the student union at Keele University. When you first came to Keele, were you nervous? asks pretend Neil Baldwin. Im never nervous, replies real Neil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/sep/26/marvellous-neil-baldwin-toby-jones-peter-bowker-film"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>A bird is watching</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/26/country-diary-bird-watching</link>
      <description>The spotted flycatcher sees me and darts out over the field, but it turns back and lands in the trees along the edge of the woods&lt;p&gt;The woods ring with the sounds of birds &lt;a href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/discoverandlearn/birdguide/name/b/blackcap" title=""&gt;feeding on insects and berries&lt;/a&gt;. A&amp;nbsp;blackcap sings briefly, and the harsh, croaking call of &lt;a href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/discoverandlearn/birdguide/name/r/raven/index.aspx" title=""&gt;an unseen raven&lt;/a&gt; echoes above the canopy overhead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I walk to the edge of the woods and look out across the fields and valley. The&amp;nbsp;sky is brightening, but the morning mist still hangs in the air, obscuring the detail of the trees in the distance, their dark forms stirring in a grey veil of&amp;nbsp;damp.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/26/country-diary-bird-watching"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Journey of a North Korean defector: from escaping by bike to singing at Harvard</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/26/north-korea-defector-journey</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Park Young-jin arrived in South Korea just a year ago, but he has already travelled to the US to perform with one of K-pops biggest stars. He talks about how his life has changed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The life of a North Korean defector is one of extreme contrasts. Born in a country with one of the &lt;a href="http://www.freedomhouse.org/country/north-korea"&gt;worlds strictest regimes&lt;/a&gt;, escaping often means discovering new freedoms and adapting to new cultures, while coping with the absence of family and friends left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That has been the experience of 24-year-old Park Young-jin, a North Korean defector who managed to flee his home country on a bicycle last year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/26/north-korea-defector-journey"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Map to the Stars review  David Cronenberg at his Jacobean best</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/25/maps-to-the-stars-review-david-cronenberg</link>
      <description>An ensemble comedy of cruelty that satirises the Hollywood film factory and echoes the excesses of Sunset Blvd&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/19/david-cronenberg-maps-to-the-stars-cannes-film-festival" title=""&gt;David Cronenberg: Hollywood actors are desperate to assert their existence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/22/julianne-moore-maps-to-the-stars-interview" title=""&gt;Julianne Moore on Maps to the Stars: The longer you live the Hollywood lifestyle, the more empty you become&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/davidcronenberg" title=""&gt;David Cronenberg&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/maps-to-the-stars" title=""&gt;Maps to the Stars&lt;/a&gt; is a macabre ensemble comedy of cruelty, insecurity and self-hate, written for the screen by Bruce Wagner and premiered at Cannes. It looks even more exquisitely horrible on a second viewing: a satire of contemporary Hollywood, with echoes of &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/36184/sunset.boulevard" title=""&gt;Sunset Boulevard&lt;/a&gt; and Postcards from the Edge, depicting a communal nervous breakdown in a town so enclosed and incestuous that everyone is part of the same symbolic sibling-hood of fear. This is one, big, unhappy dysfunctional family, in which guilty souls are afraid of failure and haunted by the return of the repressed. Every surface has a sickly sheen of anxiety; every face is a mask of suppressed pain. It is a further refinement of this directors gifts for body horror and satire. Julianne Moore plays Havana Segrand, a neurotic failing movie star in a permanent toxic state of career panic. Taking her self-esteem to a new low, she is auditioning for a remake of a 50s melodrama starring her late movie-star mother  whom she now believes abused her, thanks to sessions with a creepy new-age therapist (John Cusack). Clarices film is, evidently, a melodrama in the style of &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/78728/suddenly-last-summer-review" title=""&gt;Suddenly, Last Summer&lt;/a&gt;, with Elizabeth Taylor. Staffords 13-year-old son, Benjie (Evan Bird), is a bratty child star with a secret connection to Havanas troubled chore whore, or personal assistant, Agatha (&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/mia-wasikowska" title=""&gt;Mia Wasikowska&lt;/a&gt;), who has befriended limo&amp;nbsp;driver Jerome (&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/robert-pattinson" title=""&gt;Robert Pattinson&lt;/a&gt;). The assistant is the ultimate Hollywood figure, part of the emotional sewerage  they are the untrusted servants who must masochistically absorb all the toxic abuse dumped on them in return for an&amp;nbsp;unspoken promise that maybe, one&amp;nbsp;day, they will get an audition, or their screenplay will be picked up. It is a brilliant Jacobean nightmare; the kind of thing &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/stage/the-duchess-of-malfi" title=""&gt;John Webster&lt;/a&gt; might write if he was living in the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/19/david-cronenberg-maps-to-the-stars-cannes-film-festival" title=""&gt;David Cronenberg: Hollywood actors are desperate to assert their existence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/25/maps-to-the-stars-review-david-cronenberg"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>Long-term lovers Napoleon and Antosia back in same enclosure at Polish zoo after politician objected to their sex schedule&lt;p&gt;Two passionate donkeys who were separated because of an outcry over their lovemaking have been reunited at a zoo in Poland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The couple, together for 10 years, got into trouble when mothers expressed outrage that children had to witness their mating. A local official, Lydia Dudziak, took up their cause and persuaded the director of the zoo in Poznan to have the animals put in separate pens.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/25/donkey-couple-sex-napoleon-antosia-poland"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Canadian man caught trying to smuggle 51 live turtles under his clothes</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/25/canada-man-smuggle-turtles-groin-us-border</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;US authorities noticed irregularly shaped bulges under Kai Xus sweatpants, who had taped the reptiles to his legs and groins&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Canadian man taped 51 live turtles to his legs and groin and tried to hide them under sweatpants in an attempt to smuggle the reptiles over the Detroit border crossing, according to federal prosecutors in Michigan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man was captured as part of a surveillance operation conducted by US Fish and Wildlife Service agents. An official with the service said there has been an increase in turtle smuggling in the last year, which they attribute to demand in Asian food and collector markets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/25/canada-man-smuggle-turtles-groin-us-border"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Equalizer review  ugly, crass film smothers Denzel Washingtons charm</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/25/the-equalizer-review-denzel-washington-chloe-grace-moretz</link>
      <description>Chloë&amp;nbsp;Grace Moretz plays a prostitute saved from abuse by a glum-faced avenging angel in Antoine Fuquas tiresome effort&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/sep/25/vigilantes-hollywood-the-equalizer-denzel-washington" title=""&gt; The Equalizer: why have Hollywood vigilantes gone soft?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is something deeply ugly and crass in director Antoine Fuquas fatuous drama-thriller, based on the 80s TV show with Edward Woodward.&amp;nbsp;It has none of the style or&amp;nbsp;wit that marked Fuquas 2001 breakthrough, &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/89684/training.day" title=""&gt;Training Day&lt;/a&gt;, and Washingtons usual irrepressible charm and intelligence are smothered. He plays Robert McCall, a quiet guy working at&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;DIY superstore, perhaps retired from&amp;nbsp;some more exciting job. McCall strikes&amp;nbsp;up a platonic, fatherly friendship with a&amp;nbsp;beautiful young woman, Teri (Chlo&amp;euml;&amp;nbsp;Grace Moretz), whom he discovers is being forced to work as a prostitute by&amp;nbsp;Russian gangsters, and is&amp;nbsp;being beaten and abused. Robert quickly unveils an&amp;nbsp;almost supernatural talent for combat,  a kind of macho-gallant superpower  to hit back at these bullies on her behalf and&amp;nbsp;put right other wrongs elsewhere&amp;nbsp;in the city, too. The movie serves up the dodgiest have-your-cake-and-eat-it menu: you get to see the women&amp;nbsp;brutalised and assaulted,and also the men, the second spectacle presumably justified&amp;nbsp;by the first. And all quite without any insight or perspective. Women are entirely unimportant, and&amp;nbsp;simpering Moretz turns out to be&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;minor character, to say the very least. As for&amp;nbsp;Washington, he has no&amp;nbsp;samurai charisma here, just a&amp;nbsp;tiresome&amp;nbsp;pudding-faced reluctance to smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/sep/25/vigilantes-hollywood-the-equalizer-denzel-washington" title=""&gt; The Equalizer: why have Hollywood vigilantes gone soft?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/25/the-equalizer-review-denzel-washington-chloe-grace-moretz"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Kylie review  audience and artist alike revel in the biggest disco in town</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/25/kylie-review-echo-arena-liverpool</link>
      <description>&lt;strong&gt;Echo Arena, Liverpool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lavish yet knowing show highlights the key to Kylies enduring popularity as she embarks on her mammoth Kiss Me Once tour&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Kylie  now famous enough to drop the Minogue surname  confessed to anxieties about her return to live performance. You cant help wondering what someone who has been at the top of pop for more than 25 years can possibly have to fear. That her mammoth Kiss Me Once European tour only includes one night in Lithuania? Or that one of the confetti cannons employed on this opening night will malfunction and blast her into the Mersey? In fact, the only hint of a departure from the script comes when the singer misses a vocal cue and instantly improvises: How do you feel, Liverpool?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liverpool feels great, because the star is whisking them to the biggest disco in town, complete with dancers in foam robot outfits, lasers and trapdoors. One minute, Kylies singing in a hot tub and emerging wearing a little red heart; the next, she reappears sporting what &lt;a href="http://www.dreamstime.com/royalty-free-stock-images-rooster-weather-vane-weathercock-silhouette-image32290899" title=""&gt;looks like a weather vane&lt;/a&gt; on her head.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/25/kylie-review-echo-arena-liverpool"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Eight reasons people don't get involved</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/25/eight-reasons-people-do-not-involved-community</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The biggest difficulties involved in joining a local group are usually in our own heads  but its possible to overcome them&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I became very worried about the planet and decided to Do Something. But what? I found some experts, and asked them. One was Dr David Fleming, who had invented a clever mechanism to incentivise individuals  and entire nations  to save energy. What, in his opinion, was the most important thing anybody could do to tackle the twin threats of climate change and resource shortages?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Join the local choir, he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/25/eight-reasons-people-do-not-involved-community"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Is this heart-shaped solar farm the world's most beautiful power plant?</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/25/is-this-heart-shaped-solar-farm-the-worlds-most-beautiful-power-plant</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Heart of New Caledonia to power 750 homes in French overseas territory, reports &lt;a href="http://www.businessgreen.com/"&gt;BusinessGreen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An extraordinary heart-shaped solar farm is set to be built on the Pacific island of New Caledonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2MW Heart of New Caledonia is being built by solar company Conergy and should start producing power for 750 homes from early next year. The plant, comissioned by local beverage company Froico SA, is expected to save around 2m tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions over its projected 25-year lifetime and reduce the French overseas territorys dependence on oil, gas and coal, which generate the majority of its power today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/25/is-this-heart-shaped-solar-farm-the-worlds-most-beautiful-power-plant"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Jamie T: Carry on the Grudge review  melodic and potent</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/25/jamie-t-carry-on-the-grudge-review-melodic-and-potent</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a three-year sabbatical, gorblimey Londoner Jamie T returns with a more mature, if somewhat flawed, new album&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/21/jamie-t-interview-carry-on-the-grudge"&gt;Jamie T interview: Whatever happened to the likely lad?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a theory that trends in rock and pop music move at a much less dramatic pace than they once did. You used to get great upheavals that suddenly left the world before them looking dated: psychedelia, punk, acid house. Now were supposed to live in a less turbulent musical era, where the whole smorgasbord of the past is available online, ready for anyone to draw on, where nothing seems arcane and nothing really goes out of fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you wanted to disprove the theory, you could head to YouTube and look up the kind of artists that provided the lifeblood of the NME during the mid-to-late noughties. This was an age when what you might tortuously call mainstream alt-rock seemed to exist in the shadows of varying length cast by the Libertines and the Streets: there was a vague suggestion of the influence of grime MCs and a distinct whiff of have-a-banana-era Blur. There they all are: the MySpace-promoted singer-songwriters, the bands big on choppy, ska-influenced guitars and the kind of gorblimey accents you suspect only an expensive education can buy. Its only six or seven years since they were on Radio 1, and yet it all seems like a transmission from a bygone era.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/25/jamie-t-carry-on-the-grudge-review-melodic-and-potent"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Why Soul Boys of the Western World, a documentary about Spandau Ballet, is the film you should watch this week - video</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/sep/25/soul-boys-of-the-western-world-documentary-spandau-ballet-video</link>
      <description>After a couple of decades of royalty squabbles, the members of Spandau Ballet have come back again and hit the reunion circuit. Andrew Pulver explains why director George Hencken's documentary about the band, which follows them from New Romantic roots at the Blitz club to the present day, is well worth your time &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/sep/25/soul-boys-of-the-western-world-documentary-spandau-ballet-video"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Violent Femmes' Blister in the Sun introduced me to something dark, bitter and adult</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Growing up in Australia was all New Kids and chart hits until a chance encounter at a summer camp disco&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guprod.gnl/music/musicblog/2014/sep/18/wishing-on-a-star-made-my-sad-christmas-eve-sparkle"&gt;Wishing on a Star made my sad Christmas sparkle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/sep/11/phil-collins-saved-me-suicide-music-that-changed-my-life-no-jacket-required"&gt;Phil Collins saved me from suicide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/sep/04/bruce-springsteens-born-to-run-revived-my-love-of-music"&gt;Bruce Springsteens Born to Run revived my love of music&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;June 2014, the Troxy, east London. My brother grins at me. We have a combined age of 67, as well as partners, children, cats, mortgages and other trappings of adulthood. However, we also have a plastic pint of beer and a shot of whisky apiece. I grin back. We do the shots as the band takes to the stage. They play my favourite song first and we go wild. Everyone goes wild. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its 1991 and I have a pastel-pink Walkman, which spools to me the sounds of &lt;a href="http://www.kateceberano.com/"&gt;Kate Ceberano&lt;/a&gt;, who is currently my favourite artist after New Kids on the Block. I cant play New Kids on my Walkman, however, as all I have is a vinyl copy of their &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=By86PcLufOU"&gt;Hangin Tough&lt;/a&gt; album. Vinyl is not a mobile medium.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/sep/25/violent-femmes-blister-in-the-sun-something-dark-bitter-and-adult"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Lonely potato syndrome: how I invented a mental disorder</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/25/lonely-potato-syndrome-mental-disorder-psychological-condition</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Its possible to create a psychological condition accidentally  one that apparently spreads. No wonder getting people to appreciate the severity of genuine mental illness is such an uphill struggle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just over a month ago, I knocked up a quick &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/aug/12/robin-williams-suicide-and-depression-are-not-selfish"&gt;blogpost in response to some of the unpleasant things being said in the immediate aftermath of the tragic suicide of Robin Williams&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was my most popular post to date, with a readership that Im 99.995% sure Ill never get again, so many thanks to everyone who read and shared it. I got many nice messages about it (which is always appreciated) and some less nice messages (which isnt so much). But it also spurred some interesting discussions. Some argued that the &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2014/aug/18/robin-williams-depression-causes-suicide"&gt;true rationale for suicide is more complex.&lt;/a&gt; Others emphasised that to &lt;a href="http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/191/5/375.full"&gt;describe depression as an illness or disease is unhelpful&lt;/a&gt;. Some claimed I was glorifying depression. Others felt I was understating the issues. And many more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/25/lonely-potato-syndrome-mental-disorder-psychological-condition"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>Five things your phone provider doesnt want you to know&lt;p&gt;If you have got a spare &amp;pound;539 burning a hole in your pocket you may well be considering spending it on &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/17/apple-iphone-6-thinner-faster-slightly-cheaper-review" title=""&gt;the new iPhone 6&lt;/a&gt;. Sales of the new model, and its partner the iPhone 6 Plus, reached a record 10m globally last weekend  the first two days after its launch  &lt;a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/apple-sells-10m-iphone-6-6-plus-devices-in-first-weekend/" title=""&gt;according to Apple&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you are about to own one of these or already have a different smartphone, the temptation to spend ever increasing amounts on games, streaming films and making video calls using a phone is growing.

      <title>Five best reusable sandwich wrappers</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/25/five-best-re-usable-sandwich-wrappers</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a country that loves a sandwich, were remarkably careless with the wrappers, throwing away at least 800m bits of foil or cling-film every year. &lt;strong&gt;Erica Buist&lt;/strong&gt; tried out a few reusable alternatives&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are almost &lt;a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=how+many+days+in+the+school+year&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;aq=t&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;channel=fflb&amp;amp;gfe_rd=cr&amp;amp;ei=Zt4NVJyOA9Kq8wfy7oC4Dw#rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;amp;channel=fflb&amp;amp;q=how+many+days+in+the+school+year+UK"&gt;200 lunchtimes&lt;/a&gt; in a school year. If even half of Britains &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/number-of-schools-teachers-and-students-in-england/number-of-schools-teachers-and-students-in-england"&gt;8.2m schoolchildren&lt;/a&gt; take sandwiches to school in disposable wrappers, were looking at just shy of 800m wrappers per year. That seems like a lot of waste to generate just for sarnies, and doesnt even take into account the adults industrious enough to make and bring their own sandwiches to work. So, ever at your service, Live Better tried out some of the reusable alternatives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/25/five-best-re-usable-sandwich-wrappers"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>How to cook the perfect pasta puttanesca</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2014/sep/25/how-to-cook-perfect-pasta-puttanesca-recipe</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Are anchovies essential in whores pasta, do you top it with cheese, and what other store-cupboard standbys do you cook when the fridge is bare?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No piece on puttanesca is complete without a knowing wink to the literal translation of the name: tarts spaghetti, as Delia rather coyly has it, or whores pasta, as it is more commonly known. Usually this is just an excuse for a double entendre about the dishs coarse, fiery flavours. Whatever the truth about its origins &lt;a href="http://dobianchi.com/2008/01/13/the-origins-of-sugo-alla-puttanesca/"&gt;and myths&lt;/a&gt;, I think the most oft-quoted story, that it was a cheap dish the working girls of Naples could knock up from the cupboard between tricks, is a useful one to bear in mind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2014/sep/25/how-to-cook-perfect-pasta-puttanesca-recipe"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>Most of the shows below are real British and US programmes that debuted in 2014. One is a sitcom starting this week on Channel 4. The rest are parodies from The Simpsons.

      <title>A beginners guide to archery</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/25/beginners-guide-to-archery</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whether youre inspired by childhood games or Game of Thrones, archery is worth a shot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/25/where-to-learn-archery-clubs-city-country-horseback"&gt;In the country, in the city and on horseback: where to try archery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The centre of the target is exactly the same size as a mans head, Marcus Allen tells me. One of the teachers for my four-session basic training course, Marcus is a mild-mannered university lecturer during the week but, at the weekends, he likes to play at being a potentially lethal marksman with his impressive and very technical compound bow. He has clearly been bitten by the archery bug and is enormously informative, adding that sometimes he likes to go off and shoot foam &lt;a href="http://dinosaurs.about.com/od/dinosaurbasics/a/velofacts.htm"&gt;velociraptors&lt;/a&gt; in a wood. I wouldnt like to cross him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcus is one of a small, dedicated archery group called &lt;a href="http://www.plumpton-bowmen.org.uk/"&gt;The Plumpton Bowmen&lt;/a&gt;, who meet at least once a week throughout the year. I had little experience of archery at the start of my course, other than with a rubbish plastic bow as a child, but Im quietly confident that I have decent hand-eye coordination and a good aim.

      <title>Monster fuss: Ridley Scott alienates xenomorphs from Prometheus 2</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/25/ridley-scott-no-xenomorphs-prometheus-2-alien</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The director has said his sequel to the 2012 Alien spin-off Prometheus is unlikely to feature any more of the franchises iconic beasts &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Warning: this article contains Prometheus spoilers)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guprod.gnl/film/2014/jul/09/ridley-scott-exodus-gods-and-kings-christian-bale"&gt;First look at Ridley Scotts Exodus: Gods and Kings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ridley Scott has said that he is done with xenomorphs, the slimy, acid-haemorrhaging monstrosities from the Alien movies, prompting speculation that the hideous creatures will not be back in his forthcoming sequel to 2012s Prometheus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prometheus was billed as a film featuring the DNA of Scotts earlier film &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/alien"&gt;Alien&lt;/a&gt;, the 1979 slasher-in-space that first introduced the xenomorphs. It featured what many took to be a biological predecessor of xenomorphs, christened the deacon by Scott, which was also revealed to have human DNA. However, the veteran film-maker indicated that full xenomorphs, which were originally based on designs by the Swiss surrealist artist HR Giger, were unlikely to return in future instalments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/25/ridley-scott-no-xenomorphs-prometheus-2-alien"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Nigel Farage swings behind Team Europe in Paddy Powers Ryder Cup ad</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/sep/25/nigel-farage-paddy-power-ad-ryder-cup-ukip</link>
      <description>Eurosceptic Ukip leader makes tongue-in-cheek political U-turn for campaign based around the Ryder Cup golf contest&lt;p&gt;Im &lt;strong&gt;Nigel Farage&lt;/strong&gt; ... and I love Europe. Come again? The Ukip leader, tongue firmly lodged in cheek, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXhLMIDscTI" title=""&gt;has recorded a party political broadcast on behalf of Paddy Power&lt;/a&gt;, exhorting punters to get behind Team Europe in this weekends Ryder Cup golf contest against the US. He goes on to extoll the virtues of, um ... Europe. The wine, the food, the excellent transport systems, the clogs ... and the greatest golfers in the world, great European rivers like the Rhine ... or the Ouse, and even quotes a 2 Unlimited lyric. Just when youre wondering if the real Nigel Farage will stand up, he ends the ad by swigging from a good old pint of ale. Some things never change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/sep/25/nigel-farage-paddy-power-ad-ryder-cup-ukip"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Spain urged to swap bull run for ball run</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/25/peta-spain-swap-bull-run-ball-run</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Animal rights group Peta wants villages to follow example set by Mataelpino by using 100kg ball instead of bulls&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its a tradition that plays out each year in towns and cities across Spain: The gates open, cowbells clang and thrillseekers ready themselves to run. But these days in Mataelpino, a small village 40 miles from Madrid, whats likely to come out of the gates isnt a half-tonne bull, but rather a 100kg polystyrene ball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four years ago the village began swapping bulls for balls in its annual fiesta, pitting daredevils against a giant ball  three metres in diameter  as it gains steam heading downhill towards the village bullring.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/25/peta-spain-swap-bull-run-ball-run"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>New Radiohead album currently under way, confirms Thom Yorke</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/25/new-radiohead-album-confirms-thom-yorke</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Frontman says that the band are laying down overdubs in the studio and that he and long-time collaborator Stanley Donwood have been going through archive images and words &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/feb/24/radiohead-king-limbs-review"&gt; Radiohead: The King of Limbs  review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/feb/23/thom-yorke-radiohead-interview"&gt; Thom Yorke: If I cant enjoy this now, when do I start?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last few weeks have been relatively exasperating for Radiohead fans, as &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/feb/23/thom-yorke-radiohead-interview"&gt;Thom Yorke&lt;/a&gt; was seen frequently updating his Twitter feed to leave a trail of cryptic clues, sharing archive images, mysterious looking artwork and PolyFauna screengrabs. Naturally, rumours began circulating that these images were pointing towards a new Radiohead release or Thom Yorke solo project, so to perhaps quash any further speculation, the frontman has now revealed that the band have started to record their ninth studio album. He also said that he and long-time collaborator and artist Stanley Donwood had been taking a nostalgia trip through previously unused material:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/25/new-radiohead-album-confirms-thom-yorke"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The myth of religious violence</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/25/-sp-karen-armstrong-religious-violence-myth-secular</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The popular belief that religion is the cause of the worlds bloodiest conflicts is central to our modern conviction that faith and politics should never mix. But the messy history of their separation suggests it was never so simple&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we watch the fighters of the Islamic State (Isis) rampaging through the Middle East, tearing apart the modern nation-states of Syria and Iraq created by departing European colonialists, it may be difficult to believe we are living in the 21st century. The sight of throngs of &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/29/three-million-refugees-fled-syria"&gt;terrified refugees&lt;/a&gt; and the savage and indiscriminate violence is all too reminiscent of barbarian tribes sweeping away the Roman empire, or the Mongol hordes of Genghis Khan cutting a swath through China, Anatolia, Russia and eastern Europe, devastating entire cities and massacring their inhabitants. Only the wearily familiar pictures of &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/23/raqqa-residents-divided-us-air-strikes-isis-syria"&gt;bombs falling yet again&lt;/a&gt; on Middle Eastern cities and towns  this time dropped by the United States and a few Arab allies  and the gloomy predictions that this may become another Vietnam, remind us that this is indeed a very modern war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ferocious cruelty of these jihadist fighters, quoting the Quran as they &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/13/isis-video-david-haines-beheading"&gt;behead their hapless victims&lt;/a&gt;, raises another distinctly modern concern: the connection between religion and violence. The atrocities of Isis would seem to prove that Sam Harris, one of the loudest voices of the New Atheism, was right to claim that &lt;a href="http://www.samharris.org/site/full_text/the-reality-of-islam"&gt;most Muslims are utterly deranged by their religious faith&lt;/a&gt;, and to conclude that religion itself produces a perverse solidarity that we must find some way to undercut. Many will agree with Richard Dawkins, who wrote in The God Delusion that only religious faith is a strong enough force to motivate such utter madness in otherwise sane and decent people. Even those who find these statements too extreme may still believe, instinctively, that there is a violent essence inherent in religion, which inevitably radicalises any conflict  because once combatants are convinced that God is on their side, compromise becomes impossible and cruelty knows no bounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the modern period, religion was not a separate activity, it permeated all human undertakings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reign of terror plunged France into an irrational bloodbath, in which 17,000 men, women and children were executed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many regard the wests devotion to the separation of religion and politics as incompatible with democracy and freedom&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/25/-sp-karen-armstrong-religious-violence-myth-secular"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>John Cusack: Hollywood is a whorehouse and people go mad</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/25/john-cusack-hollywood-maps-to-the-stars-interview</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After 25 years as a star, John Cusack has seen the movie industrys dark side close up  from its misogyny to its treatment of young actors. His new film, Maps to the Stars, is brutally honest, he says&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/17/maps-to-the-stars-my-film-about-the-dark-side-of-hollywood"&gt;Bruce Wagner: Maps to the Stars  my film about the dark side of Hollywood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/14/david-cronenberg-interview-my-imagination-not-a-place-of-horror"&gt;David Cronenberg: My imagination is not a place of horror&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of summers ago, John Cusack was at a baseball game, watching the Chicago White Sox play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the next box over there was a gorgeous girl  young, but she was looking right at me, he says. I went to go to the bathroom and I saw her get up. I thought: Ohhhh  shes going to come and meet me and Im gonna  you know  I was going to be really flattered. And she was, like: I have to take a picture of you! Youre my moms favourite actor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/25/john-cusack-hollywood-maps-to-the-stars-interview"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Ida review  an eerily beautiful road movie</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/25/ida-pawel-pawlikowski-nun-road-movie</link>
      <description>A novice nun journeys through her familys secret&amp;nbsp;past in Pawe Pawlikowskis outstanding black-and-white drama&lt;p&gt;This eerily beautiful black-and-white film from Pawe Pawlikowski is, along with &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/maps-to-the-stars"&gt;Maps to the Stars&lt;/a&gt;, one of two outstanding movies now on general release after festival play that seem even fresher and clearer on a repeat viewing. Ida, which pulls off the remarkable trick of looking as if it was made when it was set  the early 60s  feels more like a restored and rediscovered classic than a new movie. &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/14/ida-london-film-festival-2013-review"&gt;I first saw it at last years London film festival&lt;/a&gt;; revisited, Ida delivers its anger and pain with a new intensity, while turning down the ambient temperature even further. There really is a bitter, wintry cold here: it is illuminated by the stark, daylit whiteness of snow, and you can feel the chill in those barnyards and draughty churches. This film has its own kind of freezer burn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agata Trzebuchowska is tremendously mysterious as a 17-year-old novitiate in a remote convent: she has the impassivity and inscrutability of youth. This is someone to whom literally nothing has happened in her life, and now we will watch her react, or try to conceal her reaction, to an onslaught of momentous events. Ida has something of the classic Polish film school, along with touches of B&amp;eacute;la Tarr and Aki Kaurism&amp;auml;ki. The cinematography shows a fondness for alienated compositions, in which faces are low down in the frame with an oppressive blankness overhead  although the images in the convent often resemble something by Vermeer. The biggest influence is probably Fran&amp;ccedil;ois Truffaut and his &lt;a href="http://www.criterion.com/films/151-the-400-blows"&gt;400 Blows&lt;/a&gt;; in fact, its final shot might represent a subtle commentary or variation on the last moments of Truffauts film.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/25/ida-pawel-pawlikowski-nun-road-movie"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The weird afterlife of the world's subterranean 'ghost stations'</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With plans afoot to transform disused London tube stations into tourist attractions, &lt;strong&gt;Drew Reed&lt;/strong&gt; digs into how they get abandoned in the first place  and what could become of them in the future&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/cities/gallery/2014/sep/25/london-underground-abandoned-tube-stations-bradley-garrett-in-pictures"&gt;Underground London: abandoned tube stations and tunnels  in pictures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1920, construction began on what was to become an important new transportation system for Cincinnati, Ohio. Local voters had given near-unanimous support to a $6m (&amp;pound;3.7m) municipal bond, and despite wartime restrictions and shortages, the project began. Little did the citys officials know that the system they were building would never carry a single passenger. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five years later, the money had run out, the federal government refused to help and construction was halted. Today, there is an entire six-mile subway system abandoned underneath the Cincinnati streets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/sep/25/-sp-world-subterranean-ghost-stations-tube-abandoned-underground"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Monarch airline: from prince to pauper</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/25/monarch-airline-prince-pauper</link>
      <description>Britains oldest surviving carrier brand flew too far and grew too fast but new money and a deal with staff on pay cuts may save it&lt;p&gt;How did it come to this? Only nine months ago Monarch was reporting a return to profit, flying record numbers of passengers, promising to raise the bar for low-cost air travel and pledging further expansion. Now the only hope for Britains oldest surviving airline brand seems to be slashing jobs, breaking with suppliers, and being sold for a dime to a secretive Knightsbridge private equity fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the hopes of 2013, a market flooded with cheap airline seats has left Monarch flapping again. It flew nearly 7 million passengers last year but with losses for 2014 running north of &amp;pound;60m  and a &amp;pound;158m deficit in its pension fund  its future hung in the balance as its Swiss billionaire owners finally lost patience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/25/monarch-airline-prince-pauper"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Turkish border guards sweep up fuel smugglers and Isis fighters alike</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/25/turkey-syria-border-crossing-harder-movement-isis-smugglers</link>
      <description>Things are much stricter now for smugglers, civilians and fighters who used to move relatively freely across Turkeys Syrian border&lt;p&gt;At the army checkpoint on the notoriously porous border that is the gateway to Syria and the expanding fiefdom of Islamic State, two conscripts stop every vehicle. There is constant traffic across the fields on the Turkish bank of the River Orontes, which is the frontier with Syria. The suspicion is that ordinary farm vehicles have swapped agriculture for a more lucrative trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large black oily puddles testify to the conscripted soldiers efforts to stop tractors smuggling diesel fuel in their tanks. We check tractors in the morning, when they go to the fields, and at night, when they come back, says one. Excess amounts of fuel are emptied from the tanks on the spot. Offenders are fined.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/25/turkey-syria-border-crossing-harder-movement-isis-smugglers"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Nightingales v 5,000 new homes: the battle over the woods of Lodge Hill</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/25/-sp-nightingales-lodge-hill-sanctuary-conservation-britain</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Plan to build on sanctuary for bird celebrated by poets for centuries undermines the entire conservation regime of Britain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each spring, Owen Sweeney rises early to listen to biggest population of nightingales in Britain singing in the woods of Lodge Hill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 5am in May its just glorious  the density of singing is tremendous, said the retired civil servant, walking through ancient oak woodland as a hobby swooped to catch a hawker dragonfly overhead. Ive taken my grandchildren to hear their first nightingale and their faces when they first hear it are just something.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/25/-sp-nightingales-lodge-hill-sanctuary-conservation-britain"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Legal aid cuts: 'The forgotten pillar of the welfare state'   a special report</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/sep/25/-sp-legal-aid-forgotten-pillar-welfare-state-special-report-impact-cuts</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As parliament takes evidence on the impact of legal aid reform, Emma Howard meets the people who are struggling to get help&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, Caroline Alexander put a request out on Twitter. It read: I need a law degree by 9am. It was the evening before she was due in court to cross examine the man she alleges raped and abused her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caroline  which is not her real name  had already represented herself at the two civil court hearings previous to this because her access to legal aid had been stopped. Her alleged attacker (her ex-partner) was at both because he was pursuing a civil case for child contact against her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even smelling him [her ex-partner] could trigger flashbacks. I still see his face sometimes when I try to go to sleep. When I had to face him in court, I tried to defend myself but I couldnt get my points across or I couldnt even speak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open contributions: &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/sep/25/are-the-reforms-to-legal-aid-just"&gt;Are the changes to legal aid just?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I begged the usher not to make me go in. I tried to prepare the night before. I tried to write down what I would say to him. I wondered: is this against the rules? Would I say this if I was a barrister? I didnt know where to look for information. I couldnt think straight and by the time I went into the courtroom I hadnt been able to prepare any questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are sending away people in Carolines position every day. It has probably taken every ounce of their courage to ring and ask for help, but they cant get proof so we cant help them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didnt understand what was going on and I felt nobody was listening to me. If Im unable to read my bills, I cant read a law book. The law is there and gives you rights but there is no way to enforce them unless youve got money in your pocket. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The removal of legal aid will start to undermine the rule of law. People will feel like the government isnt giving them access to justice and that will either lead to frustration and lack of confidence in the system, or it will lead to people taking the law into their own hands.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/sep/25/-sp-legal-aid-forgotten-pillar-welfare-state-special-report-impact-cuts"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Pseudoscience I was taught at a British creationist school</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2014/sep/25/pseudoscience-creationist-schools-uk-accelerated-christian-education-ace</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Four UK universities recognise a qualification from creationist schools teaching that evolution is a hoax and electricity can be generated from snow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students at Accelerated Christian Education schools dont graduate with GCSEs or A levels: they complete the International Certificate of Christian Education. As BBC Newsnight pointed out last month, the ICCE is unrecognised by the qualifications authority for England, Ofqual. Nevertheless, according to responses to Freedom of Information requests received by the British Humanist Association in recent weeks, four universities  Bath, Cardiff, Essex and Nottingham  recognise the ICCE as an entrance qualification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went to an &lt;a href="http://www.aceministries.com/"&gt;Accelerated Christian Education (ACE)&lt;/a&gt; school from the age of 11 to 14, and I can think of many reasons why this kind of education is a poor preparation for university. I spent half of every school day alone in a cubicle, working silently though PACEs (Packets of Accelerated Christian Education)  workbooks that incorporate religious instruction into every academic subject, for example teaching that evolution is &lt;a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/education/2014/01/creationism-and-conspiracy-evolution-inside-uks-evangelical-schools"&gt;a hoax&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have known for years that snowflakes are shaped in six-sided, or hexagonal, patterns. But why is this? Some scientists have theorised that the electrons within a water molecule follow three orbital paths that are positioned at 60&amp;deg; angles to one another. Since a circle contains 360&amp;deg;, this electronic relationship causes the water molecule to have six spokes radiating from a hub (the nucleus). When water vapour freezes in the air, many water molecules link up to form the distinctive six-sided snowflakes and the hexagonal pattern is quite evident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snowflakes also contain small air pockets between their spokes. These air pockets have a higher oxygen content than does normal air. Magnetism has a stronger attraction for oxygen than for other gases. Consequently, some scientists have concluded that a relationship exists between a snowflakes attraction to oxygen and magnetisms attraction to oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have discovered that the hydrogen canopy that may have enclosed Earth before the Flood had some very interesting effects on plant and animal life. The hydrogen in the canopy absorbed blue light, but radiated red light, so the sky was pink rather than blue! Not only did pre-Flood man see the panorama of Creation through rose-colored glasses, but the pink light had a definite effect on his mind and body. Modern scientists have discovered that pink light stimulates the adrenal glands to secrete a hormone called norepinephrine. Norepinephrine is both a tranquilliser and a neurotransmitter that both calms the person and sharpens his ability to think. The tranquilliser in the hormone can reduce stress and the accompanying medical complications (heart conditions, ulcers, etc) that come with our-hectic, modern-day lifestyles. Some drugs have the same tranquillising effect, but these drugs also decrease the ability to think and respond to the environment. The neurotransmitter in the norepinephrine sharpens the persons senses and enables him to think clearly by speeding up his nervous impulses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metal hydrogen not only filters blue light, but it also has a fiberoptic effects. This means that light from the sun was not only transmitted through the canopy, but was also spread out across the canopy. The light was dispersed around the world  even at night! At sunrise the sky was a vivid pink color. As the colour of the sky changed, the light grew in intensity throughout the morning, until it was a light pink at noon. As the light subsided during the afternoon, the color of the sky returned to vivid pink again at sunset.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2014/sep/25/pseudoscience-creationist-schools-uk-accelerated-christian-education-ace"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>A day in court for non-payment of the TV licence: What do they want us to do, kill ourselves?</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/24/in-court-non-payment-tv-licence-television-desperate-cases</link>
      <description>Almost 200,000 people were prosecuted last year for failing to buy a television licence. Should those who cant afford to pay their bills be criminalised in this way?&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of anger simmering around the crowded stairwell outside court number six, where 158 court hearings are listed for non-payment of television licence fees. About 20 people have turned up at &lt;a href="https://courttribunalfinder.service.gov.uk/courts/highbury-corner-magistrates-court" title=""&gt;Highbury Corner magistrates court&lt;/a&gt;, north London, to contest the imposition of a fine; the start time of 10am has arrived and passed, and nothing has happened. The court clerk comes to hand out means-testing sheets, so that defendants on a low income can request a reduction in their fine. Since almost everyone here is on a low income, they crowd around to take the sheets. Theres a call for a Turkish interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One man has brought his television with him, thinking that handing over the set will be the simplest way of solving the problem, but he has been prevented from bringing it up to the courtroom by security and has had to leave it with guards downstairs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/24/in-court-non-payment-tv-licence-television-desperate-cases"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Marvellous and the lasting influence of Dennis Potter's dramatic innovations</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/sep/25/marvellous-influence-dennis-potter-dramatic-innovations-bbc2-toby-jones</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The BBC2 film, starring Toby Jones, displays Potter-esque levels of experimentalism, but the late dramatists influence can be seen in many places, from Twin Peaks to Mrs Browns Boys&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/sep/21/toby-jones-marvellous-neil-baldwin"&gt;Toby Jones and Neil Baldwin in conversation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can frequently seem to a keen viewer of TV drama that the ones that arent murder mysteries are biographical: a situation symbolised by the choice on Monday nights at 9pm between New Tricks on BBC1 and Cilla on ITV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But, if the dramatic schedules have to be restricted to fictional corpses and real-life people re-animated, at least a programme going out on Thursday shows that a standard format can be delivered with thrilling originality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/sep/25/marvellous-influence-dennis-potter-dramatic-innovations-bbc2-toby-jones"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Welsh town with steel at its heart casts a wary eye at the future</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/sep/25/port-talbot-wales-steel-tata-job-cuts</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Port Talbot steel industry dates back to 1902 but after hundreds of job cuts can it cash in on demand for cars, cans and coins?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the Lord appears to have given up on Port Talbot. The Bethany chapel, which had been giving spiritual guidance to residents in the centre of this steel town since 1879, is these days a boarded-up shell that has a for-sale sign hanging outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, only a few minutes from the centre of this south Wales town, modern steelmaking, which dates back here to 1902, is still in full flow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/sep/25/port-talbot-wales-steel-tata-job-cuts"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>Brazil leads the world in cosmetic surgery and its top man is a celebrity on a par with Pele&lt;p&gt;If anyone had told the early plastic surgeons that buttock enlargements and vaginal rejuvenation would one day become a billion-dollar global industry led by Brazil, they would probably have been laughed out of the operating room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when the great and good of lasers and liposuction convened for the worlds biggest cosmetic surgery conference at the weekend, they did so in Rio de Janeiro. And the keynote speaker was a Brazilian.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/24/brazil-loves-nip-tuck-plastic-surgeon-ivo-pitanguy"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Scotland has shown how the left can finally find its purpose</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/25/scotland-politics-left-purpose-snp-green-working-class-women</link>
      <description>SNP and Scottish Green party membership has surged as women and working-class voters demand change&lt;p&gt;Last Friday, having spent a long night at a count in Falkirk, I &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2014/sep/23/britain-after-scotland-independence-referendum-political-future-video" title=""&gt;whiled away a bleary-eyed afternoon&lt;/a&gt; on George Square in Glasgow. Though the day would &lt;a href="http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/eleven-arrests-after-loyalist-no-supporters-descend-on-george-square.25379996" title=""&gt;end with ugly scenes&lt;/a&gt; as packs of pro-union thugs appeared, in the afternoon peaceful yes supporters had the place to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon enough, the &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/scottish-independence/we-are-the-45-per-cent-is-the-new-scottish-independence-campaign-on-twitter-and-facebook-9746674.html" title=""&gt;defiant Twitter hashtag the45&lt;/a&gt; (as in percent) would be in full effect, but at that point, a sense of sadness and lost opportunity was inescapable; at times, what with the vulture-like presence of the Socialist Workers party and the odd person getting lost in conspiracy theory, the whole thing threatened to put me in mind of the decline phase of the Occupy movement. That said, there were also sparks of vitality, usually of the kind one doesnt find at, say, a Labour party conference: it sounds unlikely, but a massed out-of-tune version of the Proclaimers hit Im Gonna Be (500 Miles) brimmed with an infectious sense of defianceand purpose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/25/scotland-politics-left-purpose-snp-green-working-class-women"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>British military action is needed. But it is even more vital to make common cause with all the enemies of Isis to find a political solution&lt;p&gt;Why British military action against Isiss barbarity, but not Assads butchery? And shouldnt the ill-fated legacy of Iraq instruct us to stay well clear?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the cabinet in 2003, I backed Tony Blair over the invasion of Iraq because I honestly believed Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. I was wrong: he didnt  we went to war on a lie. And the aftermath was disastrous.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/25/isis-barbarity-we-cant-stand-by-impotently"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Britains involvement in the new Iraq war is a doomed and dangerous gesture</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/25/britain-new-iraq-war-doomed-token-gesture</link>
      <description>With no proper strategy, the return to conflict will only reinforce the politics of fear that is the grimmest legacy of the Blair era&lt;p&gt;This is the moment in any war when peace goes dumb. The cause is just. The enemy is in our sights, and the provocation is extreme. Blood races through tabloid veins. It is white feathers for dissenters. The British governments evident eagerness to bomb Iraq will be &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/24/parliament-recalled-endorse-uk-airstrikes-iraq" title=""&gt;put by David Cameron to the House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; on Friday. With an election in the&amp;nbsp;offing, Labours &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/25/miliband-foreign-policy-pm-labour-leader-iraq" title=""&gt;Ed Miliband dares not disagree&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prime ministers case, &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/25/david-cameron-urges-unity-isis-evil-uk-prepares-strike-iraq" title=""&gt;made to the United Nations on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, is that the Islamic State (Isis) rebellion is an evil against which the whole world must unite. No one would quarrel with that. Unlike &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/aug/30/cameron-mps-syria" title=""&gt;Camerons abortive bid to bomb Syria last year&lt;/a&gt;, legality is covered by an invitation from Iraqs hapless rulers in Baghdad and a refusal to bomb Syria. Past mistakes in Iraq, says Cameron, should not be an excuse for inaction. We must not be so frozen with fear that we do not do anything at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/25/britain-new-iraq-war-doomed-token-gesture"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The UN climate summit reveals India's hypocrisy on saving forests</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/environment/india-untamed/2014/sep/26/un-climate-summit-india-hypocrisy-saving-forests</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Environment minister argues for historical justice on cutting carbon, but denies it to tribes living in the countrys forests&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Indias minister for environment, forests, and climate change, Prakash Javadekar, scoffed at the idea of the country &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/25/world/asia/25climate.html?_r=0"&gt;reducing emissions to counter climate change&lt;/a&gt;. He held the US chiefly responsible for the climate crisis, and therefore it had to bear the responsibility for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. That has been Indias position on climate change at international negotiations for a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developed nations have polluted the atmosphere and brought the planet to the crisis it faces today. The developing world, lagging behind in industrial development, did little to create the situation. But &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2014/sep/23/carbon-map-which-countries-are-responsible-for-climate-change"&gt;China is now the worlds biggest carbon emitter, and India is fast catching up as its economy grows&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/india-untamed/2014/sep/26/un-climate-summit-india-hypocrisy-saving-forests"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Conference convinced me that Labour can rescue the NHS  and our nation</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/25/labour-conference-rescue-nhs-ed-miliband-harry-leslie-smith</link>
      <description>I remember the terrible deprivations of the 1920s. But as long as Ed Miliband continues to listen to everyday people like me, there is hope that they will not be repeated&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was a lad, Britain was empty of real words. It was much like it is today, because &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/century/1930-1939/Story/0,6051,127027,00.html" title=""&gt;the nation was hungry&lt;/a&gt; for both bread and hope. Growing up in the rough-and-ready streets of 1920s Barnsley, I stumbled from morning to night in both desperation and fear that I wouldnt make it to adulthood. Now I am an old man, and both my knees and elbows have been scraped by the history of my generation. Though I obviously have my own views, I dont consider myself political as such  it is not in my DNA to be faithful to a party as I would be to a spouse, because politics is a fickle lover that will always desert the idealist for the pragmatist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So dont think I came to the &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labourconference" title=""&gt;Labour party conference&lt;/a&gt; without my eyes wide open. In fact, I expected to be disappointed by the machine that is called New Labour.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/25/labour-conference-rescue-nhs-ed-miliband-harry-leslie-smith"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Guardian view on unlimited time off: too good to be true</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/25/guardian-view-unlimited-time-off-too-good-true</link>
      <description>Take as much holiday as you like, says Richard Branson. If you dare&lt;p&gt;When&lt;a href="http://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/why-were-letting-virgin-staff-take-as-much-holiday-as-they-want" title=""&gt; Richard Branson announces&lt;/a&gt; that Virgin employees can take as much holiday as they want, it seems unlikely that he means to make train travel more uncertain than it already is by allowing drivers to choose duvet days at random, nor to risk passengers for New York turning up at the airport to find the flights cancelled because the cabin crew have decided to take a long weekend in Rome. In fact, the &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/24/virgin-staff-take-as-much-holiday-as-like-richard-branson" title=""&gt;offer is for employees at the family offices&lt;/a&gt; rather than any of the Virgin enterprises. And that is not the only way in which what, on the face of it, appears attractive and generous is in fact about as liberating for the employee as, say, hot-desking. It is just one more way of chaining the workers to their desks by intimating that if they go for a coffee someone will take their seat. Or their job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Branson scarcely troubled to disguise the flimsiness of his offer. The decision whether to take holiday, &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-29356627" title=""&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt;, would reflect an employees confidence that they were on top of their jobs, in complete control of all their projects, and that their absence would do no harm to the company  or their career. It is a souped-up version of turning off office emails, itself something all sensible employers should insist on, as some do in Germany, but which most employees fear would be seen as a possibly lethal breach of commitment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/25/guardian-view-unlimited-time-off-too-good-true"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>Trying to buy beer on a recent trip to Nashville left me more than a little humiliated&lt;p&gt;America is my homeland, but it hasnt been my home for almost 25 years. Whenever I return I spend a lot of time pretending not to be lost or bewildered by changes effected in my absence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ive just returned from a week in &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/travel/nashville" title=""&gt;Nashville&lt;/a&gt; with English friends who constantly deferred to my local knowledge. Id never been to Nashville before, but I still knew the difference between a dime and a nickel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/25/america-homeland-foreigner-nashville-beer"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The niqab is no reason to deny a girl an education</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/25/niqab-pupil-camden-not-how-liberal-education-should-work</link>
      <description>A school in Camden has barred a pupil for wearing a veil. This is not how a liberal education should work&lt;p&gt;Gotcha, as the Sun is surely thinking. Once again, Ed Miliband has been &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/25/sun-ed-miliband-help-for-heroes" title=""&gt;done up like a kipper&lt;/a&gt; by the tabloid of choice for the struggling low-earners he seeks to represent. And this time its not for going along with one of its patriotic publicity stunts  as when he posed with its &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/jun/13/edmiliband-sun" title=""&gt;World Cup front page&lt;/a&gt;  but for refusing. Asked on a crazily busy day to be photographed wearing a Help for Heroes charity wristband, he failed to do so, and was duly patriot-shamed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, it could have been better handled. (If youre not going to play the Suns game, fine, but tell everyone why before it does  preferably while declaring undying gratitude to war veterans and making a private donation.) But it was a cheap trick, reeking of that aggressive with-us-or-against-us patriotism that roams the streets looking for anyone who doesnt fall into step. Nobody should be bullied into wearing something to prove their allegiance to a country, whether its a bracelet or a red poppy or a saltire in face paint. And nor, arguably, should they be bullied out of wearing something.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/25/niqab-pupil-camden-not-how-liberal-education-should-work"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>Ed Miliband can no longer taunt Cameron about the Nigel Farage threat. A bloody nose looms for his own party too&lt;p&gt;In his &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-29338520" title=""&gt;keynote speech in Manchester&lt;/a&gt;, Ed Miliband taunted the prime minister for lying awake at night worrying not about the future of the United Kingdom but rather the United Kingdom Independence party. Badum-tish!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like much of the speech the joke fell a bit flat because, as it happens, David Cameron isnt the only one who has been losing sleep over Ukip. In previous years, the Labour conference treated the Faragist threat as private grief for Conservatives into which Miliband need not intrude. And it remains the case that Ukip takes more votes from the Tories. In a number of key marginal constituencies, Nigel Farage is making Labours work easier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/25/panic-over-ukip-spread-labour-ed-miliband-nigel-farage"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Julian Assange: 'When you post to Facebook, you're being a rat'</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/25/julian-assange-eric-schmidt-google-wikileaks</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Assange joins party for his book When Google Met WikiLeaks to discuss the consequences of Googles power in the 21st century&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does a wanted man have a book party? On Wednesday night at Babycastles, a Manhattan videogame-art collective, Julian Assange celebrated the publication of his new book, When Google Met WikiLeaks. He was present via videochat. The collectivists projected him on their walls. A crowd had formed to see the shining-haired hacker king  youngish New Yorkers, mostly. They stood or sat and drank beers as Assange talked about the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Assange said: Compare the mission statements of Google and the NSA  the NSA, who literally say, We want to collect all private information, pool it, store it, sort it, index it, and exploit it. Whereas Google says, We want to collect all private information, pool it, store it, sort it, and sell those profiles to advertisers. Really, theyre almost identical. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/25/julian-assange-eric-schmidt-google-wikileaks"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Linda Thompson and Jon Boden: two generations of folk-rockers unite</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/25/linda-thompson-jon-boden-folk-rockers-island-records</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Island Records is reviving the pink label for a new wave of folk-rockers. 1970s legend Linda Thompson reveals what went on the first time round, and new signing Jon Boden of Bellowhead reflects on the modern folk scene&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its late summer in the garden of one of Londons most celebrated folk clubs, sunlight pouring through the trellis on to two linchpins of the genre. They come from different eras: the younger man is bearded and gentle; the older woman wears white sunglasses and a sparkly blue jumper bearing the legend Aloha!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both are at the Troubadour to talk about the revival of Island Records pink label  a home for pioneering folk music and singer-songwriters in the late 1960s and early 70s  and reflect on the folk music they have made, and loved, through the decades.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/25/linda-thompson-jon-boden-folk-rockers-island-records"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/sep/25/edward-snowden-sweden-alternative-nobel-prize-video</link>
      <description>Edward Snowden issues a recorded statement after being awarded Sweden's Right Livelihood Honorary Award, dubbed the 'alternative Nobel Prize'. The National Security Agency whistleblower says he accepts the award on behalf of those who risked their lives to help 'resist unlawful and disproportionate mass surveillance'. He says the award serves as a 'vindication' for such efforts &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/sep/25/edward-snowden-sweden-alternative-nobel-prize-video"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Julian Casablancass New York state of mind: too many white people are having brunch at the weekend</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2014/sep/25/julian-casablancas-new-york-white-people-having-brunch-the-strokes</link>
      <description>New York City is no place for a streetwise rocknroller like the Strokes singer, educated in the school of hard knocks  and the elite De Rosay school in Switzerland&lt;p&gt;Of all the multifarious forms of entertainment laid out before us in this glittering digital age, Lost in Showbiz loves good old rocknroll the best. It asks you: what other art form can affect us so potently and immediately, as if it has a direct connection to the darkest recesses of our souls? Look at the events that took place when Billy Joel played Madison Square Gardens last week: &lt;a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/man-beaten-drunks-billy-joel-concert-sues-msg-article-1.1950572" title=""&gt;according to&amp;nbsp;a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, there was a brawl in the audience. Yes, the so-called guardians of the moral majority may condemn them: you know what Billy Joel fans are like, theyre just crazy kids, living for thrills with no thought of tomorrow, in an out-of-control teenage world where pleasure is the only aim. But can you blame them for getting a little wild, when their passions are inflamed by the frenzied appeal to our base, animalistic urges that is Just the Way&amp;nbsp;You Are? Thats the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJWM5FmZyqU" title=""&gt;visceral, uncontainable force of rocknroll in action&lt;/a&gt;, my friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But its more than just the raw power that makes LiS love rocknroll. Its the people who make it. What a crowd! Theres the crusaders for equal rights, such as Kanye West, who recently told the audience at a Sydney gig that they all had to stand up unless you got a handicap pass and you get special parking and shit, then, after ascertaining one concert-goer used a wheelchair, said: Its fine, and carried on. Its fine, youre in a wheelchair! What a fillip for the disabled! Theres the free-thinking polymaths, such as will.i.am, who has just designed a car: not just any car, but a car equipped with four 180-degree external cameras that allow panoramic photos to be captured on your phone. Sure, theres people out there wholl say that taking 180-degree panoramic photos on your phone while youre driving sounds incredibly dangerous  in fact, it sounds like the kind of thing you would find yourself doing immediately before accidentally running someone over  but the blue-sky-thinking rocknroller doesnt need their mind hemmed in by your so-called rules. Its like Funkadelic said: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiqmEibSY0I" title=""&gt;free your mind and your ass will follow&lt;/a&gt;  in this case probably on to a crowded pavement at 40mph, but lets not get bogged down in petty detail.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2014/sep/25/julian-casablancas-new-york-white-people-having-brunch-the-strokes"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Denzel Washington on Equalizer: 'We had Navy Seals train us'</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/25/denzel-washington-religion-vigilantes-improvised-weapons-equalizer</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Denzel Washington reunites with &lt;a href="http://http://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/feb/01/culture.peterbradshaw"&gt;Training Day&lt;/a&gt; director Antoine Fuqua for their slick new action thriller The Equalizer. They talk about &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/sep/25/vigilantes-hollywood-the-equalizer-denzel-washington"&gt;street justice&lt;/a&gt;  and why it took so long&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last time Denzel Washington worked with director Antoine Fuqua, playing a corrupt cop in crime thriller Training Day, he won a best actor Oscar. But its taken more than a decade for the pair to work together again. Their slick, violent reinvention of 1980s TV spy drama The Equalizer stars Washington as retired intelligence officer Robert McCall, an enigmatic loner with OCD symptoms and latent badass training. Pushed to the brink, he takes on Bostons Russian mobsters virtually single-handedly, dispatching tattooed thugs with corkscrews, nail guns and other improvised weapons (his day job in a hardware store gives him options here).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sitting down together in London, Washington and Fuqua talk about the film that brought them back together.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/25/denzel-washington-religion-vigilantes-improvised-weapons-equalizer"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Steve McQueen has made some astonishing art and films, and they are expertly unpicked in Kirsty Youngs fascinating interview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have to say, says Kirsty Young, towards the end of her &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04hml41"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desert Island Discs&lt;/strong&gt; interview with Steve McQueen&lt;/a&gt;, I have found you today to be entirely affable and giving, smiling a lot and great company. But a lot of people  A lot of people, it turns out, wondered if McQueen might have made a prickly, hostile interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Im a black man! Im used to that, he says, apparently unbothered. Is that what that is? asks Kirsty. Should I say anything more? Honestly, Im a black man, what do you think? When I walk into a room people make a judgment, I dont care. Totally not. If he did, he supposes, he would be locked up in jail where, frankly, a lot of people are.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/sep/25/steve-mcqueen-desert-island-discs"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>What? Sir Elton John is homosexual? We had simply no idea</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2014/sep/25/elton-john-is-homosexual-we-had-no-idea-middle-east-broadcasting-centre</link>
      <description>The hitherto obscure Middle East Broadcasting Centre has been busy outing celebrities. Prepare for a shock&lt;p&gt;Lost in Showbiz confesses it had never heard of the Middle East Broadcasting Centre before this week, which now seems something of a terrible oversight. It looks at the description of one of its drama series on its &lt;a href="http://www.mbc.net/en.html" title=""&gt;English-language website&lt;/a&gt;  the storyline revolves around RIM that suffer from extreme poverty, which drives a pimps for the prosecution in order to work in his favor, and&amp;nbsp;succeed this man in his quest and escape out to Cairo  and thinks: that sounds absolutely mind-blowing  what else have I missed? Can you get it&amp;nbsp;on Freeview?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, LiS was alerted to the Middle East Broadcasting Centre by its publication this week of what it called the List of Disgrace: Hollywood Celebrities Who Announced Their Homosexuality. Theres almost nothing about this story that LiS doesnt find amazing. Theres the fact that the List of Disgrace contained Cameron Diaz and Daniel Radcliffe, neither of whom actually seem to be homosexual. Theres the fact that it described Ricky Martin as one of the first to announce their sexuality, apparently steadfast in the belief that no one had come out before 2010. And theres the subsequent apology that the Middle East Broadcasting Centre issued: One of the junior editors of the website published an article offending some of the big Hollywood celebrity names, which by no means was reflective of the sites editorial policy nor point of view, without prior verification of the facts of the story plagiarized from another official site. Basically: &lt;a href="http://www.mbc.net/en/mbc2/articles/Mbc-net-apologizes-for-an-article-published-offending-some-Hollywood-celebrities.html#comment|list" title=""&gt;oops, the rabidly homophobic work experience did it&lt;/a&gt;, sorry about that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2014/sep/25/elton-john-is-homosexual-we-had-no-idea-middle-east-broadcasting-centre"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Peace Train singer blames extortionate ticket prices for scrapping first show in New York City in 40 years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cat Stevens, known as Yusuf Islam, has announced that his New York show on his US comeback tour has been axed in a bid to quash ticket touts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/16/cat-stevens-us-tour-peace-train-late-again"&gt;seven-city concert tour in North America this December&lt;/a&gt;, his first series of shows in the US since 1976, has now been shaved down to six because of the extortionate prices of tickets appearing on resale websites. Stating that the Peace Train is going to arrive at New York a little bit later than expected, the singer, 66, explained his ongoing qualms with printed tickets and apologised to fans. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/25/cat-stevens-cancels-new-york-date-over-ticket-tout-concerns"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Obshezhitiye or obshaga, the Russian word for dormitory, translates as living together. Dorm life is replete with formal and informal rules that university students learn to live by; winning over supervisors, negotiating curfews, sharing space, and protecting privacy. Photographer Pascal Dumont met the residents of a dozen student dorms in the Russian capital &lt;a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/multimedia/photogalleries/dormitory-life-of-moscows-students/5198.html"&gt;for The Moscow Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/5422dc48e4b0013c1bf2dc7a"&gt;Student life around the world  share your photos with GuardianWitness &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2014/sep/25/student-life-russia-pictures-obshezhitiye-obshaga"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/society/gallery/2014/sep/25/west-africas-ebola-crisis-in-pictures</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nine months into the worlds most serious Ebola outbreak, scientists say they have learned more about how the potentially lethal virus behaves and how it might be contained. Since its beginnings in Guinea in December, the disease - which is transmitted between humans but originated from contact with wild animals such as bats - has spread with lethal effect across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. There have also been cases in Nigeria and Senegal&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/gallery/2014/sep/25/west-africas-ebola-crisis-in-pictures"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>
