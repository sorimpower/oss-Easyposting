		<title>Does the GIL Make Your Ruby Code Thread-Safe?</title>
		<description><![CDATA[<p><img style="float: right;margin-right: 18px;margin-bottom: 18px" src="http://www.rubyinside.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/lock.png" alt="" width="125" height="125" />This is a guest post by <a href="http://www.jstorimer.com/">Jesse Storimer</a>. He teaches the <a href="http://www.jstorimer.com/products/unix-fu-workshop?utm_source=ri&#38;utm_medium=web&#38;utm_campaign=gil-3">Unix fu workshop</a>, an online class for Ruby developers looking to do some awesome systems hacking in Ruby and boost their confidence when it comes to their server stack. Spots are limited, so check it out the class while there's still room. He's also the esteemed author of <a href="http://www.jstorimer.com/products/working-with-unix-processes">Working with Unix Processes</a>, <a href="http://www.jstorimer.com/products/working-with-tcp-sockets">Working with TCP Sockets</a> and <a href="http://www.jstorimer.com/products/working-with-ruby-threads">Working with Ruby Threads.</a></p>
<p>There are some misconceptions in the Ruby community about this question surrounding MRI's GIL. If you only take one thing away from this article today, let it be this: The GIL does not make your Ruby code thread-safe. <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/does-the-gil-make-your-ruby-code-thread-safe-6051.html" class="read_more">Read More</a></p>]]></description>

		<title>This Week in Ruby: Matz on Ruby 2.0, Numerous Conference CFPs, Tenderlove on define_method</title>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to this week’s roundup of Ruby news, articles, videos, and more, cobbled together from my e-mail newsletter, <a href="http://rubyweekly.com/">Ruby Weekly.</a> Sorry these roundups have been missing for a couple of months, I've been focusing very heavily on the e-mail newsletters which are continuing to grow like crazy! :-) I hope to get back into blogging more soon.</p>

  <a href="https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2013/3/6/matz_highlights_ruby_2_0_at_waza"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/nlga/uploads/item/image/9315/thumb_matz.png" width="133" height="100" style="float: right; margin-left: 14px; margin-bottom: 16px; border: 1px solid #1173c7" /></a>
<p><a href="https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2013/3/6/matz_highlights_ruby_2_0_at_waza" style="font-weight: bold;">Matz on Ruby 2.0</a>
Matz spoke about Ruby 2.0 ('the happiest release ever') for 30 minutes at the Heroku Waza event a week ago and the video is already available to watch. He stresses that "Ruby 1.8 will die soon" and encourages everyone to upgrade. <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/this-week-in-ruby-matz-on-ruby-2-0-numerous-conference-cfps-tenderlove-on-define_method-6043.html" class="read_more">Read More</a></p>]]></description>

		<title>A Simple Tour of the Ruby MRI Source Code with Pat Shaughnessy</title>
		<description><![CDATA[<p></p>
<p>I'm not in Ruby core or, well, even a confident C coder anymore, but I've long enjoyed digging in the <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby">Ruby MRI source code</a> to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IX1NfwQP1s">understand weird behavior</a> and to pick up stuff for my <a href="https://cooperpress.com/rubyreloaded">Ruby course.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://patshaughnessy.net/">Pat Shaughnessy</a> is also a fan of digging around in Ruby's internals and has written some great posts like <a href="http://patshaughnessy.net/2012/6/29/how-ruby-executes-your-code">How Ruby Executes Your Code</a>, <a href="http://patshaughnessy.net/2012/7/26/objects-classes-and-modules">Objects, Classes and Modules</a>, and <a href="http://patshaughnessy.net/2012/4/3/exploring-rubys-regular-expression-algorithm">Exploring Ruby's Regular Expression Algorithm.</a></p>
<p>When Pat released his <a href="http://patshaughnessy.net/ruby-under-a-microscope">Ruby Under a Microscope</a> book, I knew it would be right up my street! He digs into how objects are represented internally, why MRI, Rubinius and JRuby act in certain ways and, of course, "lots more."</p>
<p>I invited Pat to take a very high level cruise through the MRI codebase with me so we could share that knowledge with Ruby programmers who haven't dared take a look 'under the hood' and to show it's not as scary or pointless as it may seem. <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/ruby-mri-code-walk-tour-6020.html" class="read_more">Read More</a></p>]]></description>

		<title>The Split is Not Enough: Unicode Whitespace Shenigans for Rubyists</title>
		<description><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.rubyinside.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/spaced.png" alt="" title="spaced" width="640" height="225" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5981" /></p>
<p>That code is legal Ruby! If you ran it, you'd see 8. How? There's a tale to tell..</p>
<h3>The String with the Golden Space</h3>
<p>I was on IRC in <a href="http://nwrug.org/">#nwrug</a> enjoying festive cheer with fellow Northern Rubyists when ysr23 presented <a href="https://gist.github.com/4118156">a curious problem.</a></p>
<p>He was using a Twitter library that returned a tweet, "@twellyme film", in a string called reply. The problem was that despite calling reply.split, the string refused to split on whitespace. Yet if he did "@twellyme film".split in IRB, that was fine.</p>
<p>International man of mystery <a href="https://twitter.com/will_j">Will Jessop</a> suggested checking $; (it's a special global variable that defines the default separator for String#split). <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/the-split-is-not-enough-whitespace-shenigans-for-rubyists-5980.html" class="read_more">Read More</a></p>]]></description>

I've editorialized the title somewhat but this article by Charles Nutter is a great look into the world of 'refinements' in Ruby 2.0, what they're intended for, and all of the challenges they throw up, both for developers and language implementers. <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/this-week-in-ruby-ruby-2-0-refinements-cost-of-gcprofiler-and-britruby-cancelled-5975.html" class="read_more">Read More</a></p>]]></description>
