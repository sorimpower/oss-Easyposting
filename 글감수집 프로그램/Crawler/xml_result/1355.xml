				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These days you have <strong>an awful lot of options for hosting your website</strong>, so many that it’s easy to get lost. How much should you pay? Is support important to you, or are you a tinkerer who likes to do your own thing?</p>
<p>Put in different terms, are you a master chef who can cook a delicious meal with the right assortment of ingredients, or would you rather go to a nice restaurant and just sit back and enjoy the experience?</p>
<p>Let’s dive in.</p>
<h3>An Overview Of Hosting Categories</h3>
<p>A couple of years ago, choosing a hosting company was a lot simpler. Shared hosting providers had relatively low prices (between $5 and $15 a month), while other companies rented out dedicated servers from $500 a month up to as much as tens of thousands of dollars a month. If you knew your budget, then the decision was easy. Today, not so much.</p>
<p>At the entry level, we still have <strong>shared hosting providers and managed hosting services</strong>, which are still technically “shared” but which add a lot of value and specialization. We have virtual private servers (VPS), nowadays usually called “<strong>cloud servers</strong>”. They differentiate themselves based on the virtualization technology that they use and how much computational power and memory are included in their packages.</p>
<p>Finally, we have the option to <strong>rent a dedicated server</strong> &mdash; also known as co-location, whereby you place your own box in a data center. This hasn’t really changed that much, except that data centers have become a lot more sophisticated and computers have become smarter than they were three to five years ago.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/hosting-large-preview.png"><img src="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/hosting-preview.png" alt="hosting-preview" width="500" height="100" /></a><sup class="po" id="note-1"><a href="#1">1</a></sup><br /><em>(<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/hosting-large-preview.png">See large version</a><sup class="po" id="note-2"><a href="#2">2</a></sup>)</em></p>
<h4>Page Speed Matters. A Lot.</h4>
<p>Before your head spins with hosting jargon, let’s talk a bit about page speed. Back in 2010, Google stated that the loading time of your website would factor into your ranking. So, if you care about search engine optimization and free traffic from Google, then you should care about your website’s performance.</p>
<p>Forrester Consulting <a href="http://www.akamai.com/html/about/press/releases/2009/press_091409.html">found</a><sup class="po" id="note-3"><a href="#3">3</a></sup> that about 47% of Internet users expect a website to load in under 2 seconds. Aberdeen Group <a href="http://www.tagman.com/mdp-blog/2012/03/just-one-second-delay-in-page-load-can-cause-7-loss-in-customer-conversions/">has data</a><sup class="po" id="note-4"><a href="#4">4</a></sup> that shows that a 1-second delay in page-loading time can result in a 7% loss in conversions. All of these studies were conducted a couple of years ago, and since then the web has only sped up! Or has it?</p>
<p><strong>Look at your website’s loading speed</strong> with a tool such as <a href="http://tools.pingdom.com/fpt/">Pingdom</a><sup class="po" id="note-5"><a href="#5">5</a></sup> or <a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/">WebPagetest</a><sup class="po" id="note-6"><a href="#6">6</a></sup>. If it’s above 2 seconds, then you could get a massive increase in revenue just by switching to a better performing hosting package or maybe even switching hosting companies altogether.</p>
<p>How big of an increase? <a href="http://www.tagman.com/mdp-blog/2012/03/just-one-second-delay-in-page-load-can-cause-7-loss-in-customer-conversions/">Tagman has the answer</a><sup class="po" id="note-7"><a href="#7">7</a></sup>: “Let’s say a website’s average ticket size is $75 and conversion rate is 5%. So if it takes their pages an additional second to load then for every 400,000 unique visits each month, there would be a loss of $1.3m in revenue per year.” As you can see, performance affects the bottom line in a huge way.</p>
<p>Don’t forget, though, that a good hosting service will help your website only so much. If your WordPress installation has dozens of plugins activated or if your theme is bloated or poorly written, then you could have serious performance issues no matter where you’re hosted.</p>
<p>Let’s dissect the different types of hosting solutions, then.</p>
<h3>1. Shared Hosting</h3>
<p>If you’ve ever had a website, then you’ve come across shared hosting providers, which offer packages from as low as $1.99. They are considered the “public transportation” of the hosting world: extremely low fees, yet little flexibility and a lot of overcrowding. As soon as your website grows, you can expect a lot of problems, such as bandwidth limiting and slow response times. Slow response times happen because the only way that hosting companies can offer packages for such a low price is by putting a lot of websites on the same server.</p>
<p>For example, if a hosting provider puts you on a computer that costs them $400 to run every month, then they would need 200 clients on that machine just to break even. And to <strong>get the maximum profit out of each server</strong>, they would need to add hundreds upon hundreds of clients to it, overloading the otherwise good configuration.</p>
<p>Think of the difference between a dedicated server that an online business doesn’t share with anyone, thus ensuring the highest possible performance, and a machine that has a couple hundred websites on it.</p>
<p>Shared hosting providers are often overloaded with support questions as well. Hours, if not days, can pass before you receive an answer to your question, and most of the time the answer won’t be of any help because the provider does not employ WordPress specialists. Most hosts provide only basic support, at the level of the operating system. On top of that, you are literally just one out of thousands of customers &mdash; per server!</p>
<p>However, there are advantages &mdash; the rock-bottom price obviously being one of them. If you’re starting a business, this is <strong>a very cost-effective solution</strong>. In addition, you can run all kinds of scripts on these accounts; you’re not limited to WordPress. You can use the space to test different projects. And if your website gets low traffic (a couple of hundred visitors per month), then you can host it very affordably and not have to worry about system administration or anything else.</p>
<h4>Who Is This For?</h4>
<p>If your revenue doesn’t depend much on your website or if you have a hobby blog, then an affordable shared hosting package is a good choice.</p>
<p>Several well-known examples are <a href="https://www.godaddy.com">GoDaddy</a><sup class="po" id="note-8"><a href="#8">8</a></sup>, <a href="http://mediatemple.net/webhosting/shared/">Media Temple&#8217;s Shared Hosting</a><sup class="po" id="note-9"><a href="#9">9</a></sup>, <a href="https://www.bluehost.com">Bluehost</a><sup class="po" id="note-10"><a href="#10">10</a></sup>, <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com">DreamHost</a><sup class="po" id="note-11"><a href="#11">11</a></sup> and <a href="https://www.namecheap.com">NameCheap</a><sup class="po" id="note-12"><a href="#12">12</a></sup>, among many others.</p>
<h3>2. Managed Hosting</h3>
<p>In the past, managed hosting meant one thing: <strong>hardware and operating system management</strong> for separate boxes (either virtual or “bare metal”). You would hire an expert or team of experts to look after your server, and they would install an operating system on it, install security patches, change the hard drives when they break and perform other tasks. We’ll discuss this in detail later.</p>
<p>Relative newcomers to the hosting scene are <strong>application-level managed hosts</strong>. Companies that specialize in hosting one or another application are popping up almost every day. WordPress is one such application &mdash; and no wonder: WordPress has become the go-to content management system (and, lately, the go-to web application platform) for many people.</p>
<p>This hosting category is similar to shared hosting, but you could think of it as a new generation of shared hosting. It’s like a local grocery store that specializes in few but high-quality products, one that knows you by name and that is unlike those huge everything-for-cheap supermarkets.</p>
<p>Instead of allowing (and supporting) all kinds of scripts, these companies build their infrastructure around one &mdash; usually open-source &mdash; product. These companies know their product very well, they have fine-tuned their machines and operating systems for it, and they have a dedicated support team that knows the ins and outs of it.</p>
<p>Considering that <a href="http://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all">roughly 23%</a><sup class="po" id="note-13"><a href="#13">13</a></sup> of all websites online today run on WordPress, you can imagine that there is a lot of demand for hosting services custom-tailored to WordPress and only WordPress.</p>
<p>Managed WordPress hosts deal with all of the back-end tasks of running a WordPress blog so that you don’t have to. This frees you to focus on what truly matters: selling your product to customers. Beyond hosting your website, the providers also offer WordPress-specific experience that will <strong>help you optimize your web presence in many ways</strong>: speed, security, uptime, core and plugin updates, and theme and plugin compatibility.</p>
<p>Although this solution is more expensive than shared hosting &mdash; prices start at around $10 and go up to as much as $3,000 per domain &mdash; the benefits are usually worth it, even for relatively small websites. Many of the features &mdash; including customizable backup options, one-click staging areas, integrated CDN support and much more &mdash; cannot be found in packages anywhere else. Let’s look at some of the most common benefits of managed WordPress hosting.</p>
<h4>Support</h4>
<p>Support is not limited to basic problems with your hosting account. These hosts provide advice on WordPress plugins, themes, settings, updates and so on. Many of their employees are active contributors to WordPress’ core or have published plugins and themes for WordPress. They know the ins and outs!</p>
<h4>Security</h4>
<p>Fine-tuning your hosting environment (both software and hardware) will make your WordPress website or application as optimized as it can be, thus making it quick to load and to respond. Security is another important aspect, and that’s where the word “managed” comes in. Managed hosts keep your WordPress instances up to date for you. They also keep an eye out for malicious plugins and themes, and they work with you to prevent hacks of your website through known security holes.</p>
<p>If you have to optimize the environment of just one open-source package, then hardening the server and securing the system become a lot easier. At the level of the operating system, administrators don’t have to install a hundred different packages in order to enable customers to run Magento, Joomla, Dolphin, WordPress and many other platforms at the same time! Having fewer packages frees up a lot of resources for other important processes, and the system will naturally have many fewer entry points for malicious attacks.</p>
<p>Speaking of entry points, did you know that WordPress’ core is extremely safe? The biggest vulnerability occurs when someone is running a version of WordPress that is out of date by several years. Too many people simply do not update their core files, despite it truly being a one-click affair. Managed hosting providers make sure that core files are always up to date, and they’ll even update for you if needed!</p>
<h4>Caching</h4>
<p>Most of the time, managed WordPress hosts have their own caching system that is custom built for WordPress and that is a lot faster than any plugin-based ones! That’s why most don’t allow plugins such as W3 Total Cache and WP Super Cache. If you’ve had trouble setting up either of those in the past, then you’ll be thankful for this. Not having to worry about any of the technical mumbo jumbo is a blessing when you have a business to run!</p>
<p><strong>Caching can be done in many different ways.</strong> First, there is object caching, which is accomplished by running Memcached or, lately, a Redis-based in-memory datastore service and a WordPress plugin counterpart. You would have to activate this for your website (or the host would do it for you). This will take a load off the database and the PHP interpreter, thus speeding up your website a lot.</p>
<p>In addition, modern configurations take advantage of the so-called reverse proxy wherever possible. This could be the immensely popular Varnish or something like the built-in FastCGI Cache of the Nginx web server. These essentially take a snapshot of your website, saving a full copy of the final WordPress-generated HTML pages. By default, these usually break dynamic parts of the page, such as the “Hey, Joe” part of the navigation bar once the user is logged in, the “Latest comments” section, and the shopping cart.</p>
<p>But with a good amount of tweaking, you can get the configuration right. And the speed is unbeatable. Instead of at least three software modules working on each request from each visitor (those modules being the PHP interpreter, the MySQL database server and the web server’s software itself), you can have only one: the reverse proxy. Less computation means much faster page-loading times!</p>
<p>These cannot be used on general shared hosting accounts because there’s no way that a hosting provider could write a configuration for all of the open-source PHP scripts out there! This is where dedicated hosts excel: creating configurations that work extremely well for WordPress and only WordPress.</p>
<h4>Backups</h4>
<p>Regularly backing up your website might not seem important, until your server’s hard drive gives up and your data is not recoverable! Or perhaps your website will get infected so badly that restoring it from a clean backup point would be easier than manually cleaning up everything.</p>
<p>Managed WordPress hosts back up your website regularly (usually daily). So, if the worst happens, you’re covered. <strong>Be sure to read the fine print</strong>, though. Some companies do not back up the <code>wp-content</code> or <code>uploads</code> folders, in which case you could lose all of your images, which would make the backup not worth much!</p>
<p>The disadvantages of managed hosts are the heftier prices and the lack of support for any other web applications. WPEngine, for example, lets you run other PHP scripts on its servers, but it doesn’t support them in any way. Other companies actively discourage customers from running anything else on their machines, meaning that customers would have to get an account with a general hosting provider to run something alongside their WordPress installation. These hosts dedicate their entire infrastructure to WordPress on the assumption that you can do almost anything with WordPress nowadays, including complete forum systems, complex CRM solutions, social networking websites, and crowdfunding marketplaces &mdash; the list is long.</p>
<h4>Who Is This For?</h4>
<p>Managed hosts are good for people who run their business on WordPress. These hosts deliver great performance, fine-tuned servers, a lot of exclusive services custom tailored to WordPress users, and affordable prices.</p>
<p>Given how important your online business is, a managed hosting account for $30 a month is probably a great deal, especially if you take into account the extra income that an optimized environment will bring in.</p>
<p>Some companies that offer WordPress-specific hosting are<br />
<a href="http://mediatemple.net/webhosting/wordpress/">Media Temple</a><sup class="po" id="note-14"><a href="#14">14</a></sup>, <a href="https://kinsta.com">Kinsta</a><sup class="po" id="note-15"><a href="#15">15</a></sup>, <a href="http://wpengine.com/">WPEngine</a><sup class="po" id="note-16"><a href="#16">16</a></sup>, <a href="http://websynthesis.com/">Synthesis</a><sup class="po" id="note-17"><a href="#17">17</a></sup>, <a href="http://getflywheel.com">Flywheel</a><sup class="po" id="note-18"><a href="#18">18</a></sup> and <a href="https://pagely.com">Pagely</a><sup class="po" id="note-19"><a href="#19">19</a></sup>.</p>
<h3>3. Virtual Private Servers</h3>
<p>If you know your way around Unix-based operating systems, then you might want to look into building a custom stack on a VPS or a bare-metal dedicated server. Digital Ocean’s price for an entry-level virtual server, which can serve a couple of low-traffic websites, is only $5 a month. You can also get a free node with Amazon AWS, with specifications similar to those of Digital Ocean’s droplet. As cloud computing has become more and more popular, these virtualized servers have become popular, too. For a fraction of the cost of a dedicated server, you can get your own (virtual) machine, and tune it to your exact needs.</p>
<p>The downside is that you usually don’t get any support, and you will have to do several things yourself: keep an eye on system components, install web and database server software, keep everything updated and, of course, configure all of the applications in a (mostly) Linux-based environment. There is also the “bad neighbor” problem: Because <strong>hardware resources are shared between many virtual machine users</strong>, poor performance is possible if someone else is overusing the resources of the machine that your account is located on.</p>
<p>VPS’ have different tiers, based on the service level, from absolutely no support to fully managed. A fully managed VPS will usually install all of the required software, keep it (and the operating system) updated and proactively monitor the server to minimize downtime. Obviously, the monthly price goes up with your requirements.</p>
<h4>Who Is This For?</h4>
<p>All in all, VPS is a cheap way to get as much flexibility as you need, with the option to deploy popular software packages (including WordPress) in one click. Don’t forget, though, that you will need to be very familiar with installing Linux via the command line in order to run a VPS and resolve problems.</p>
<p>Notable VPS players are <a href="https://www.linode.com">Linode</a><sup class="po" id="note-20"><a href="#20">20</a></sup>, <a href="https://digitalocean.com">Digital Ocean</a><sup class="po" id="note-21"><a href="#21">21</a></sup>, <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon AWS</a><sup class="po" id="note-22"><a href="#22">22</a></sup>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com">Microsoft Azure</a><sup class="po" id="note-23"><a href="#23">23</a></sup>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud</a><sup class="po" id="note-24"><a href="#24">24</a></sup> and <a href="http://mediatemple.net/webhosting/vps/">(mt)&#8217;s VPS hosting</a><sup class="po" id="note-25"><a href="#25">25</a></sup>.</p>
<h3>4. Dedicated “Bare Metal” Servers</h3>
<p>Having your own dedicated server is almost the same as a VPS, but instead of sharing a massive pool of hardware resources with others via virtualization, you get to use “all the metal” of the computer for your website only. Prices usually start at $100 a month, but the sky is the limit. Packages for thousands of dollars a month are not rare either, although those machines serve really large applications that draw millions of visitors each month or that require unusually high computational power.</p>
<p>The downside (other than the price tag) is that you have to deal with occasional hardware failures. This is different from the other categories we’ve looked at because if, for example, a hard drive fails and you don’t have another one mirrored, then you’ll face hours (perhaps even days) of downtime. If you don’t have any backups whatsoever, then you’re out of luck completely. A faulty CPU or RAM unit can cause serious headaches, too!</p>
<h4>Who Is This For?</h4>
<p>A dedicated server is definitely not for everyday website owners. This is getting into the enterprise end of hosting solutions. However, if you prefer to drive a Ferrari just because you can, then this is the one to get.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>As promised in the introduction, you have quite a lot of options to choose from! Hopefully, having read this article, you now have a clearer picture of the different packages available, and you will be able to make a decision based on your website, requirements and budget!</p>
<p>Did I leave out something important? I’d love to hear your thoughts.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People use their mobile devices everywhere: on the train, while waiting in line, sitting on the couch. As much as we aim to design our mobile apps and websites for contextual use, testing their usability in context can be challenging.</p>
<p>While getting out in the field for user testing is not always realistic, simulating much of that contextual experience in a lab is possible. <strong>One approach to mobile testing is participatory design</strong>.</p>
<p>A participatory design test session typically takes about an hour and has four parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Uncover the user’s mental model.</li>
<li>Enable the user to document their entire experience.</li>
<li>Have the user sketch their ideal experience.</li>
<li>Ask for the user’s feedback on designs from previous sessions.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ve conducted this type of study while researching how visitors to Cars.com’s app use their mobile device while purchasing a car on a dealer’s lot. The artifacts from this study are included in the steps below.</p>
<h3>1. Immersed And Aware</h3>
<p>A usability test typically starts with warm-up questions. A participatory design session is no different, although the questions are a lot more in-depth. This portion is meant to uncover the participants’ actual usage of your app or website and any pain points they experience.</p>
<p>The goal is to bring awareness to the participant and to put them in the context of how they would be using the product. Start broadly and then narrow the focus. You might want to break down questions into the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>When</strong> do they use the app or website? Is it when a need arises? Is it based on timing?</li>
<li><strong>Where</strong> are they typically during the usage? Is it location-based?</li>
<li><strong>How long</strong> do they use the product in one session?</li>
<li><strong>What tasks</strong> do they usually accomplish in one session?</li>
<li><strong>How satisfied</strong> are they overall with their interaction with the product, and how would they rate the product and how well it enables them to accomplish what they need?</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, we first asked participants general questions about the duration of their car search and about other cars they’ve test-driven. We then focused on their visit to the dealership to purchase a car. They were asked to assess their satisfaction with the process, as well as their mobile usage. The purpose of the interview here is to place the participant in the right mental context. It also helps the moderator to create awareness of the steps that follow.</p>
<h3>2. Document And Express</h3>
<p>Once the stage is set and the participant is immersed in the context, the next step is to chart a timeline of their entire journey with the product. This exercise is particularly helpful if it encompasses not just when the participant used the app or website, but the actual goal they were trying to accomplish when using this product as a tool. For example, if the goal was to book a flight on an app, then the timeline would begin with the need to book a flight and would end with the completed transaction.</p>
<p>Here are the items you might need for this portion of the session:</p>
<ul>
<li>a timeline drawn on paper and marked with a beginning and an end,</li>
<li>a pen,</li>
<li>stickers in two or more colors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Draw boundaries on the timeline to mark the beginning and end for the user. In the car shopping study, the timeline initially looked like this:</p>
<figure><img src="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/01-dealership-visit-start-opt.png" alt="The timeline given to participants in the car shopping study." width="500" height="116" /><figcaption>The timeline given to participants in the car shopping study.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Participants then filled in the steps. This process enabled us to see patterns across all dealership visits, and it triggered the participants’ recollection of details that might have been forgotten with oral recounting.</p>
<p>Once the user has drawn out the timeline, use colored stickers to overlay emotions. The simplest approach is to use two colors, one for negative emotions and one for positive. However, you could get more granular and have participants indicate particular emotions. This enables them to indicate any frustration they felt during the process and at what point the app fell short of solving their problems. Capturing emotion in this way gives you a quantitative measure of a qualitative aspect of the user’s interaction with your product.</p>
<p>After multiple sessions, place the participants’ timelines side by side. The patterns that emerge will tell a story of how people are using the product, where their pain points are and what’s working well. To synthesize the results, create an aggregate timeline based on the number of responses and the frequency of repeated emotions.</p>
<p>Here is the aggregate timeline from the car shopping study:</p>
<figure><img src="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/02-dealership-visit-opt.png" alt="Aggregate timeline from car shopping study." width="500" height="530" /><figcaption>Aggregate timeline from car shopping study.</figcaption></figure>
<p>All users followed a similar progression from the time they entered the dealership to the time they drove off the lot in their new car. They also felt similar frustrations during the negotiating and financing phases. The third color in the timeline, yellow, indicates their mobile usage on the car lot. This was helpful because the exercise shows not only when they used their phone as an aid to buying a car, but also when they would have liked to have used their phone to relieve a frustration. Such an exercise is also useful in planning future features.</p>
<h3>3. Create Aspiration</h3>
<p>After the timeline exercise, the participant is as in-context as they’re going to be in a lab. They have now recalled not only what they did, but how they felt while doing it. Now, have them create a design or feature that they would have liked to have had to solve the problems that arose in either part 1 or 2.</p>
<p>For this portion, have the following items on hand:</p>
<ul>
<li>blank sheet of paper with a phone outline;</li>
<li>writing and drawing utensils;</li>
<li>cutouts of certain features you’re considering (even if they’re just portions of wireframes);</li>
<li>stencils, such as form buttons and icons;</li>
<li>tape and scissors.</li>
</ul>
<p>This exercise is great for discovering new approaches to a design or new features. As with the timeline, draw boundaries. By cutting out certain features, stencils or shapes, you are giving the participant a starting point. The design at the end of this portion could be a mixture of features that are hand-drawn and taped onto the page.</p>
<p>If the participant has trouble getting started, revisit the timeline from part 2 and have them list a set of features they would have liked to have had. Use this list as a springboard to focus on one feature in particular. If the participant still hesitates to sketch anything, have them work with materials you provide. Using the cutouts of possible features, they can prioritize which features they’d like by taping them to the blank sheet of paper with a phone outline. An alternative is to have them simply write a list. In the car shopping study, several participants who had trouble getting started were prompted to write a list of features they would have liked and then to rank that list in order of priority or interest.</p>
<p>Synthesize the output from this exercise in the same way you did for the timeline in part 2. If most participants used stencils or cutouts to depict possible features, place them side by side to pick out patterns.</p>
<p>Here is what the synthesis of the cutouts looked like after the car shopping study:</p>
<figure><img src="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/03-phone-cutout-opt.png" alt="Synthesized results from participatory design session." width="500" height="600" /><figcaption>Synthesized results from participatory design session.</figcaption></figure>
<h3>4. Provide Feedback</h3>
<p>This last step is a good way to wrap up the session. If you are already considering certain designs, have participants provide feedback on them. By this step, the participant will have essentially become your co-designer. You could also show them designs from previous sessions to get an unbiased perspective. In the car shopping study, we sought the opinions of participants on various designs we were considering. We also asked what they thought of various aspects of the test, so that we could refine our methodology.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>When we design new features, we usually get our information in one of two ways. One common way is to fall back on broad assumptions about our users or to rely heavily on large-scale research. The other way is to design a feature and then test it in a very specific setting. Participatory design bridges the gap between the two ways, and it provides context that’s typically absent in a usability lab. This approach accomplishes several things:</p>
<ul>
<li>It enables us to uncover the user’s mental model.</li>
<li>It establishes how the user would interact with the feature in context.</li>
<li>It gives the user an opportunity to provide feedback on what features would be useful to them.</li>
<li>It allows participants to flex their creative muscles and to be a co-designer on a product they’ve used before.</li>
<li>And it gives you a fresh point of view.</li>
</ul>

But what about icon design? Icon design is a very specific skill that overlaps illustration, screen design and, of course, visual design. An icon designer needs to understand lighting, proportions and, most importantly, the context of the icon itself.</p>
<p>The BBC published an interesting article about icon design and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph">skeuomorphism</a><sup class="po" id="note-4"><a href="#4">4</a></sup> one year ago, titled &#8220;<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22840833">What Is Skeuomorphism?</a><sup class="po" id="note-5"><a href="#5">5</a></sup>&#8221; It’s definitely worth reading because it explains why icons often reflect the real world and the thinking behind it.</p>
<p>Another pretty interesting read is &#8220;<a href="http://www.creativefreedom.co.uk/icon-designers-blog/what-we-can-learn-from-early-icon-design/">What We Can Learn From Early Icon Design?</a><sup class="po" id="note-6"><a href="#6">6</a></sup>&#8221; It is a quick retrospective of icon design and mentions, among other things, one of the most famous icon designers ever, <a href="http://www.kare.com/">Susan Kare</a><sup class="po" id="note-7"><a href="#7">7</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I remember reading an article a few years ago that definitely influenced my career as a designer. Some points in the article were obvious, but they made me think about icons in a different way. Sometimes, the best way to learn is from mistakes you make or from mistakes that people more experienced than you have made. &#8220;<a href="http://turbomilk.com/blog/cookbook/icon_design/10_mistakes_in_icon_design/">10 Mistakes in Icon Design</a><sup class="po" id="note-8"><a href="#8">8</a></sup>&#8221; is a good read and a useful resource for anyone who wants to learn more about icons and icon design. It is relatively old, dating back to 2008, but some of the examples are still pretty sound. The article stresses the importance of consistency in an icon set and how composition works (i.e. how many elements to use in an icon), and it gives important tips on dealing with metaphors, with practical examples. This is key in our job.</p>
<p>Is the icon you are designing going to be used on the web? Perhaps in a mobile app? In a toolbar? Somewhere else? These are the questions that icon designers must asks themselves before starting work on a project. The answer will affect the icon’s details, reflections, shadows, background and many other features.</p>
<h3 id="section1">1. Fireworks And Icon Design</h3>
<h4>Why Fireworks?</h4>
<p>I have been using Fireworks now for nine long years, creating work that ranges from web design to complex UI design and, in the last few years, icon design as well. Fireworks has proved to be excellent software for all of these tasks because it combines powerful vector and bitmap editing tools.</p>
<p>I am not going to revisit the <a href="http://ivomynttinen.com/blog/the-endless-fireworks-vs-photoshop-battle/">long-running debate</a><sup class="po" id="note-9"><a href="#9">9</a></sup> about what is the best tool for UI design (which usually comes down to Photoshop and Fireworks). Above all, I am not a Fireworks evangelist. <strong>Ideas matter most</strong> &mdash; the choice of tool is up to the designer. Nevertheless, I’ve noticed that many people underestimate the power of Fireworks, dismissing it as second-tier software. Having a vast amount of experience with both Photoshop and Fireworks, I can only respond that, for speed and pixel-perfection, <strong>Fireworks is faster</strong> for screen design. It’s precise, easy to use and straightforward. That’s why I have picked it as the main tool in this step-by-step tutorial on icon design.</p>
<h4>A Word About Icon Design</h4>
<p>My dissertation back in university was on symbols, icons and pictograms. This subject was one of my favorites back then (and still is). What utterly fascinated me was that you could <strong>convey a message with an icon or symbol</strong>. Words aren’t needed for an icon to be understood by the majority of cultures in the world (at least, if the icon is relevant). Designing for the future means exactly that. I’ve always found the idea of a memorable metaphor to be interesting. Designing icons requires a lot of planning and thinking: As in drawing and illustration, the designer is responsible for choosing elements that will make the metaphor more or less relevant. Good icons turn different aspects of culture into something comprehensible in many cultures and countries.</p>
<p>One of the most successful icon metaphors in modern history is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_metaphor">desktop</a><sup class="po" id="note-10"><a href="#10">10</a></sup>, used in operating systems, where the desktop is treated like a place to hold documents, folders, archives, pictures and files. (We’ll talk about icon design in detail in the following paragraphs. If you like the topic, you’ll find some useful links in the &#8220;Further Reading&#8221; section at the bottom of this article.)</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In this tutorial, we will explore some general principles that relate more to skeuomorphic design than to flat design (light, shadow, size and proportion, etc.). I will also cover some general techniques that I follow in icon design. So, by all means, pick up your favorite tool to follow along, whether it’s Illustrator, Sketch or Photoshop. I’ll be using Fireworks to show its core potential and to draw parallels with other vector tools. (This is my first tutorial for Smashing Magazine. I plan to write a couple of more articles that explore icon design and the features of two other popular tools, <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html">Illustrator</a><sup class="po" id="note-11"><a href="#11">11</a></sup> and <a href="http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch</a><sup class="po" id="note-12"><a href="#12">12</a></sup>.)</p>
<h4>Files for This Tutorial</h4>
<p>To follow this tutorial fully, download the icon we will be designing:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2337409/Rocket-Icon-Design.fw.png">Download Rocket-Icon-Design.fw.png</a><sup class="po" id="note-13"><a href="#13">13</a></sup>, a layered Fireworks PNG file</li>
</ul>
<p>This layered Fireworks PNG file will help you follow the process step by step. The file is meant for reference. I encourage you to replicate the steps in a new file, with a blank canvas. Have fun!</p>
<p><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2337409/Rocket-Icon-Design.fw.png"><img src="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/rocket-icon-design-preview.png" alt="Download the layered Fireworks PNG file [Rocket-Icon-Design.fw.png]" width="500" height="333" /></a><sup class="po" id="note-14"><a href="#14">14</a></sup></p>
<p>Let’s get started!</p>
<h4>All Vector? Yes!</h4>
<p>We won’t be using any raster (i.e. bitmap) images. Everything will be created with vector shapes and live filters. This means you will be able to easily adapt the final image to different sizes and resolutions.</p>
<p>Fireworks supports screen illustrations of up to 6000 &#215; 6000 pixels (actually, even <a href="https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/9440/adobe-fireworks-cs6-maximum-image-dimension">up to 10,000 &#215; 10,000</a><sup class="po" id="note-15"><a href="#15">15</a></sup>), which is more than enough for the super-large HD displays of today’s mobile and desktop devices. And it also exports files to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">SVG</a><sup class="po" id="note-16"><a href="#16">16</a></sup> format (with the help of a <a href="http://fireworks.abeall.com/extensions/commands/#Export">free extension</a><sup class="po" id="note-17"><a href="#17">17</a></sup> that was covered in a <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/11/06/even-more-fireworks-extensions-optimized-design-workflow/#exportcommands" title="Optimizing The Design Workflow With Fireworks Extensions, Part 3, section Export Commands">recent article</a><sup class="po" id="note-18"><a href="#18">18</a></sup> on Smashing Magazine). Using SVG as an exporting format gives you a lot of flexibility. You can use the resulting image right on the web or edit it further with pretty high fidelity in many other graphic design tools, including Adobe Illustrator CS6 and CC.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Similarity and contrast, connection and separation, grouped and ungrouped are all ways to describe the varying sameness and difference between elements. Based on the information they carry, we’ll want some elements to look similar, to indicate that they are related in some way. We’ll also want to show that some elements are different and belong to different groups.</p>
<p>Key to showing both is the visual characteristics of elements and their relationships. If two elements are related in some way, then they should show similar visual characteristics. If the elements are different, then they should look different.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This is the third post in a series on design principles. You’ll find the first two posts here:</p>

</ul>
<h3>Primitive Features</h3>
<p>How do you show contrast and similarity between elements? The answer lies in the primitive features of the elements.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vanseodesign.com/web-design/organize-information-visual-perception/">Primitive features</a><sup class="po" id="note-3"><a href="#3">3</a></sup> are the intrinsic characteristics or attributes that an element might have. For example, what color is the element? How big is it? What shape is it?</p>
<p><img src="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/primitive-features-opt.png" alt="primitive-features-opt" width="500" height="259" /><br/><em>These elements have different primitive features &mdash; in this case, of shape, color and texture.</em></em></p>
<p>Each of these things communicates something about the element. If one heading is bigger than another, then we assume the bigger heading is more important. We might view an element with a shape that’s jagged and sharp as being dangerous.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an element’s attributes need to be compared to the same attributes of another element in order to have meaning. The headings from the previous paragraph are a good example. A heading should only be bigger than another heading or another piece of text. The comparison is necessary for bigger to mean anything. It’s through comparisons like these that we communicate similarity and contrast.</p>
<p>By giving visually similar characteristics to multiple elements, we communicate that something is similar about the elements. If two elements on a web page are both red circles, it’s natural for a viewer to ask why. Why are both red? Why are both circles? The likely conclusion is that the elements are related in some way beyond how they look. The elements’ similarity implies that they carry a similar message.</p>
<p>Likewise, by applying visually different characteristics to multiple elements, we communicate that something is different about the elements and the messages they carry.</p>
<p>Any <a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Visual_search#Factors_that_modulate_search_performance">characteristic of an element</a><sup class="po" id="note-4"><a href="#4">4</a></sup> that can be varied can be used to make elements look the same or different. A few characteristics, however, are most often used to show similarity and contrast. In no particular order, these are:</p>
<ul>
<li>size,</li>
<li>shape,</li>
<li>color,</li>
<li>value,</li>
<li>texture,</li>
<li>position,</li>
<li>orientation.</li>
</ul>
<p>A rectangle and a circle contrast in shape. Two red items are similar in color. A red rectangle and a red circle contrast in shape and show similarity in color. How you balance the similarity and contrast of elements through their visual characteristics will determine much about what those elements communicate to the viewer.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> While primitive features are the primary way to visually show contrast and similarity, we have other ways to show both &mdash; for example, the actual content that the elements carry. The words “stop” and “go” contrast. The words “stop” and “cease” are similar. Images contrast with text; long paragraphs contrast with short paragraphs; and so on.</p>
<h3>Contrast</h3>
<p>Human beings are wired to notice difference. It’s a survival mechanism to quickly differentiate a friend from something that wants to eat us. Being able to quickly determine that was vital to returning safely home to the cave at night.</p>
<p>Our ability to quickly notice differences is what makes contrast so powerful. Contrast attracts attention. It draws the eye. It gets noticed. By giving an element characteristics that are visually different from the elements that immediately surround it, we can create points of interest and emphasis. In fact, because the contrast of an element with its surroundings is so good at drawing attention to the element, it’s perhaps the most effective way to add interest and excitement to a design.</p>
<p>Contrast does more than attract attention. It establishes boundaries between elements, too. For example, contrasting the background color of the main content and that of a sidebar is one way to show where one ends and the other begins.</p>
<p>Differences that stand out can <a href="http://daphne.palomar.edu/design/emphasis.html">provide emphasis</a><sup class="po" id="note-5"><a href="#5">5</a></sup>, highlighting important elements and information. The greater the difference, the greater the contrast will be. The greater the contrast, the more important the element will appear.</p>
<p>For example, two ways to set off text are bolding and italicizing. Boldness typically shows more contrast and, thus, stands out more. Spotting bold text at a glance or from a distance is easier than spotting italicized text.</p>
<p>If two elements are meant to be different, go big with the contrast. You don’t want viewers to wonder whether the difference is intentional. Make sure the contrast is obvious and clearly intentional. Leave no room for misunderstanding. Don’t contrast text that’s 16 pixels with text that’s 15  pixels. People won’t notice the difference immediately and, once they do, it will appear to be more of a mistake than a conscious decision.</p>
<p>Be careful not to overdo it. <a href="http://www.designingforinteraction.com/wroblewski.html">Use contrast sparingly.</a><sup class="po" id="note-6"><a href="#6">6</a></sup> If everything contrasts and tries to draw attention to itself, then nothing will stand out. You’ll end up with visual noise that causes confusion.</p>
<p>Too much contrast can break the harmony and unity in a design, leading to chaos and confusion. This might be what you’re after in a certain design, but more often than not it isn’t. Decide which few elements need to stand out, and make them look very different from everything else.</p>
<h4>Contrast and Gestalt</h4>
<p>While every gestalt principle is about showing similarity and contrast in some way, I want to point out two of them. Contrast is critical to determining the figure-ground relationship and showing <a href="http://www.vanseodesign.com/web-design/dominance/">dominance and focal points</a><sup class="po" id="note-7"><a href="#7">7</a></sup>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Figure-ground</strong><br />
One of the first things we do when viewing a composition is to determine <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/05/16/design-principles-space-figure-ground-relationship/">what’s the figure and what’s the background</a><sup class="po" id="note-8"><a href="#8">8</a></sup>. This relationship helps to set context for everything else in the composition. Figure and ground need to contrast with each other or else the viewer will have difficulty determining which is which.</li>
<li><strong>Focal points</strong><br />
These are elements of attraction and interest. They’re designed to look different from their immediate surroundings. The contrast is what helps them stand out and draw attention. The element that stands out the most in the composition is the dominant element. Elements that stand out in a composition but to a lesser degree are focal points.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/contrast-and-similarity-opt.png" alt="contrast-and-similarity-opt" width="500" height="302"><br/><em>Contrast and similarity at work: The green circles and orange bars are similar to other green circles and orange bars, but they contrast with each other.</em></p>
<h3>Similarity</h3>
<p>The same survival mechanism that enables us to quickly see difference also helps us to see when things are the same. It points us to who or what we can trust and to what might be dangerous. Being able to recognize similarity is why <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/patternicity-finding-meaningful-patterns/">human beings are excellent at finding patterns</a><sup class="po" id="note-9"><a href="#9">9</a></sup>. Patterns help us understand the world around us, provide context and make learning quicker, to the point of something becoming intuition or instinct.</p>
<p>When we design two or more elements to look similar, we are indicating that what’s true about one is true about the other. If one of the elements is important, then the other one is likely important, too. If one element is clickable, then other elements that are visually similar will probably be clickable, too. It’s how we can quickly recognize links in a block of text. Visual contrast shows that links are different from the rest of the text, while the visual similarity among links tells us, once we’ve discovered what one does, that all of the links are clickable.</p>
<p>Similarity is about showing connection and showing that multiple items are related in some way. It brings familiarity and consistency to a design.</p>
<p>Similarity complements our natural <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=yUalr7fhZMEC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=working+memory+schema+mental+models&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Nip6RBZGfM&amp;sig=a7rLq7wM-EotwoNReIx6k16U2tE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-A11U_r3HM2Jqga8iYDwCA&amp;ved=0CHoQ6AEwDQ#v=onepage&amp;q=working%20memory%20schema%20mental%20models&amp;f=false">strategies for processing information</a><sup class="po" id="note-10"><a href="#10">10</a></sup>. When we take in our visual surroundings and attempt to make sense of it all, we naturally group objects into chunks in order to hold more information in our working memory. We further group, organize and structure everything before it becomes part of our long-term memory.</p>
<p>Designing similar information to be visually similar helps the user to process and comprehend the information, which are two critical goals of design.</p>
<p>The more that primitive features of elements look the same, the more similar they’ll look and the more viewers will think they’re the same. They’ll appear <a href="http://guymanningphotography.wordpress.com/2012/02/05/group/">grouped and related</a><sup class="po" id="note-11"><a href="#11">11</a></sup> in some way, even if just one characteristic is shared; and the more they look the same visually, the more they’ll be perceived as being the same.</p>
<p>We <a href="http://www.andyrutledge.com/gestalt-principles-2-similarity.php">use similarity to build structure</a><sup class="po" id="note-12"><a href="#12">12</a></sup> and pattern. Any similarity between two elements in a composition implies a structure. Additional similarity fills out the structure and leads to pattern, texture and rhythm.</p>
<p>Not all signals that show similarity are equal. In the image below, would you group the objects by shape or color? Do you see a group of circles and one of squares, or do you see one red group and one blue group?</p>
<p><img src="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/red-blue-circle-square-opt.png" alt="red-blue-circle-square-opt" width="500" height="340" /></p>
<p>You probably noticed color first, grouping the elements as red and blue. This suggests that color is a stronger communicator of similarity than shape. This is not absolute, however. For example, someone with red-green color blindness wouldn’t likely notice the difference between red and green objects before noticing the shapes of those objects.</p>
<h4>Similarity and Gestalt</h4>
<p>Again, every <a href="http://www.vanseodesign.com/web-design/gestalt-principles-of-perception/">gestalt principle</a><sup class="po" id="note-13"><a href="#13">13</a></sup> is about how we perceive the similarity or difference between objects. Many of them can be read as tips to show similarity.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>closure</strong><br />
different elements that may be part of a similar whole</li>
<li><strong>symmetry and order</strong><br />
mirrored elements that appear to belong together</li>
<li><strong>uniform connectedness</strong><br />
similarity through visually connecting elements</li>
<li><strong>common regions</strong><br />
similar items enclosed together</li>
<li><strong>proximity</strong><br />
similarity through enclosures in space</li>
<li><strong>continuation</strong><br />
similarity through rhythms in space</li>
<li><strong>common fate</strong><br />
similarity through movement</li>
<li><strong>parallelism</strong><br />
similarity through orientation</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Relationship Between Similarity And Contrast</h3>
<p>Contrast and similarity show the relationships between elements. <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/contrastandmeaning">Nothing has meaning in isolation.</a><sup class="po" id="note-14"><a href="#14">14</a></sup> An element needs to be shown in context with other elements.</p>
<p>What does one large element cornering a smaller element in a design imply? What does one block of text being indented more than others with light gray suggest?</p>
<p><img src="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/cornered-circle-opt.png" alt="cornered-circle-opt" width="500" height="400" /><br/><em>A large circle cornering a small circle</em></p>
<p>Contrast and similarity are really just opposite ends of a scale. On one end of the scale, objects look entirely different; on the other end, they look exactly the same.</p>
<p>Most of the time, we’re somewhere in between the extremes, and the things we design will share some but not all characteristics. Similarity and contrast are expressions of where along the scale objects lie relative to each other.</p>
<p>Even though I haven’t been explicit about it, everything I’ve said about either similarity or contrast applies to the other. Having one is impossible without also having the other. Contrast is a lack of similarity, and similarity is a lack of contrast. It’s all about where it lies on the scale.</p>
<p>Thinking about them together makes them more impactful. You can use a single feature, such as color, to show that several elements are related, and then use a different color to show that several other elements are related but different from the first group. With just two colors, we can create two distinct groups of connected elements.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3009605/work-smart/how-color-coded-notes-make-you-a-more-efficient-thinker">Color coding</a><sup class="po" id="note-15"><a href="#15">15</a></sup> in this way is an effective way to categorize information so that the viewer can discover and understand at a glance.</p>
<p>When everything is the same, you get tedium. When everything is different, you get noise. The best designs have a healthy mix of similarity and contrast and show a clear understanding of what they’re trying to communicate.</p>
<h3>Examples Of Contrast And Similarity</h3>
<p>Contrast and similarity can be found on every website. Both need to be present. Imagine a website having no contrast. We’d all have a hard time reading text if it and the background were the same color. Just as difficult would be each word or phrase having a different style.</p>
<p>I’ll point out some of the contrast and similarity on the websites below. There’s more of each than what I’ll mention. I want to offer enough examples to get you thinking and then let you take over. Look at and study different designs, and work at truly improving your skill in balancing contrast and similarity.</p>
<h4>David Simon</h4>
<p>One of the first things you’ll notice on <a href="http://davidsimon.com/">David Simon’s website</a><sup class="po" id="note-16"><a href="#16">16</a></sup> is the contrast between background colors, which makes it easy to distinguish one part of the page from another. The logo stands out as a dark object against a light background of space.</p>
<p><a href="http://davidsimon.com/"><img src="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/david-simon-opt.jpg" alt="david-simon-opt" width="500" height="517" /></a><sup class="po" id="note-17"><a href="#17">17</a></sup></p>
<p>The image contrasts with everything to draw the eye. The background of the posts’ dates, the full uppercase used for the meta data for comments, and the background color of the menu item for the current page are also examples of contrast drawing the eye and communicating something meaningful.</p>
<p>Links in the menu are all styled the same, as are the links to recent posts. Both are separated with horizontal lines. Each menu contrasts with the other to signal difference. Fonts are consistent throughout. The headings and body text contrast in typeface, but their difference is consistent across the website.</p>
<p>Links in the body could stand out more to make clear they’re links, although the designer might have deliberately made them less obvious in order not to interrupt the flow of reading. Headings could also have been made to stand out better, although it is pretty clear that they are not a part of the main text.</p>
<h4>Mike Kus</h4>
<p>The home page of <a href="http://mikekus.com/">Mike Kus’ website</a><sup class="po" id="note-18"><a href="#18">18</a></sup> focuses on different projects that Mike’s worked on. Most of the page is empty, but notice how that makes each element stand out. The text contrasts with the background, as do the paintings against the background wall texture.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Mike has changed his home page since I wrote this. What you see in the screenshot below is the previous version.</p>
<p><a href="http://mikekus.com/"><img src="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/mike-kus-homepage-opt.jpg" alt="mike-kus-homepage-opt" width="500" height="292" /></a><sup class="po" id="note-19"><a href="#19">19</a></sup></a></p>
<p>The paintings also contain the only color variety on the page. All other information is in the same dark gray.</p>
<p>Also, notice how the paintings are framed, indicating that they have something in common. In this case, they represent projects. Note, too, that the background shows similarity through its pattern of bricks. It’s clear what is figure and what is ground.</p>
<p>On Mike’s “About” page, below, the lone image of Mike contrasts with everything else. The blue button to “Get in touch” is the only element with color. You might not contact Mike, but it won’t be because you don’t know how. Buttons across the website have the same blue.</p>
<p><a href="http://mikekus.com/"><img src="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/mike-kus-about-opt.jpg" alt="mike-kus-about-opt" width="500" height="1064" /></a><sup class="po" id="note-20"><a href="#20">20</a></sup></p>
<p>Mike’s name as the logo is repeated as the main heading on the page. The header contrasts with the background, as do the backgrounds of the various sections of the page below. Links in the menu share the same uppercase styling. Social icons at the top are repeated along the bottom.</p>
<p>Fonts are also used consistently, with headings in a sans-serif and body text in a serif, contrasting with each other.</p>
<h4>Electric Pulp</h4>
<p>The logo on <a href="http://electricpulp.com/">Electric Pulp’s website</a><sup class="po" id="note-21"><a href="#21">21</a></sup> is a red circle of moderate size. It contrasts well with everything else that is immediately visible. Notice how the color is repeated in the main navigation to indicate the current page.</p>
<p><a href="http://electricpulp.com/"><img src="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/electric-pulp-opt.jpg" alt="electric-pulp-opt" width="500" height="427" /></a><sup class="po" id="note-22"><a href="#22">22</a></sup></p>
<p>Headings across the website are big, bold and set in all caps. Headings and body text also contrast consistently across the website, with the former in a sans-serif and the latter in a serif.</p>
<p>Click into the “Notes” section and you’ll see previous and next links with background colors that contrast with the main background. Background color is also used to distinguish different sections of the page.</p>
<p>Most buttons on the website are a contrasting red (a color often used to set off elements) and change to blue on hover. However, on the “Work” page, the first button reverses this (it’s blue and changes to red on hover). Whether this is deliberate or accidental is hard to tell. Nevertheless, the principle of contrast is maintained.</p>
<h4>Lowdi</h4>
<p>One last website to consider is <a href="http://lowdi.com/">Lowdi’s</a><sup class="po" id="note-23"><a href="#23">23</a></sup>. The screenshot below is of the home page. Notice how color is used for both contrast and consistency.</p>
<p><a href="http://lowdi.com/"><img src="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/lowdi-home-opt.jpg" alt="lowdi-home-opt" width="500" height="740" /></a><sup class="po" id="note-24"><a href="#24">24</a></sup></p>
<p>Color clearly delineates the start and end of sections. And the repetition of color creates a rhythm throughout the page. Notice how the yellow background of the price stands out, while also drawing the visitor’s eye down to the picture of the product.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Contrast and similarity have different functions. They are used in varying degree and in combination. You’ll always see some of both because neither exists without the other. Changing one means also changing the other.</p>
<p>Showing that some things are the same and some are different is the first step in <a href="http://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/7-page-design/3-visual-design.html">visual communication</a><sup class="po" id="note-25"><a href="#25">25</a></sup>. It’s the primary way that viewers derive meaning.</p>
<p>Contrast and similarity are clues to design elements. Differences draw our attention, and similarity transfers what we know about one element to another.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the goal is to contrast similar layers: making the elements in one group look similar to each other, but different from another like group of elements. The way we structure contrasting and similar elements creates hierarchy, flow and compositional balance, topics we’ll get to later in this series.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As mobile designers, we have a stark decision to make: do we spend time learning new tools and changing our design processes to create our own transitional interfaces, or a<strong>re the tools that we&#8217;ve been using good enough?</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s an old writing adage that advises writers, whenever possible, to &#8220;show, don&#8217;t tell&#8221; when bringing characters to life. The goal is to reveal the story through the <em>character’s</em> experiences instead of the <em>author’s</em>.</p>
<p>When designing mobile products, we share a similar burden. Dammed up inside our heads are creative waterfalls of fresh interactions, transitions, and animations. But how are we supposed to communicate them to our teams, our developers? How do we get them out of our heads? Through a game of charades?</p>
<p>I’m guilty of that last one.</p>
<p>Not being able to “show” &mdash; in an efficient way &mdash; the interactions and animations that bring our designs to life is one of the common struggles plaguing our industry. The static mockups favored in our past are no longer good enough. They simply don’t do the job. Even relative newcomer Sketch — for all of its strength over Photoshop, the Goliath — can only create static screens that must be strung together, struggling to tell our product’s stories.</p>
<p>Exacerbating the urgency of this challenge is the simple fact that we now design for screens that can be tapped, pinched, swiped, zoomed, and more. There’s no way around the fact that our interfaces must become transitional, alive, and reactive to fingers. The mouse is becoming a relic of the past. </p>

<p>Below, we&#8217;ll explore:</p>
<ul>
<li>How prototyping has, of late, become an essential ingredient for creating the next generation of mobile apps</li>
<li>How two prototyping veterans use this in their daily workflows for their products teams and clients</li>
<li>The benefits prototyping provides</li>
<li>Ways you can incorporate this skill into your design workflow</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mobile Designers Are Hungry For A Better Way</h3>
<p>Over the past year, there’s been a growing hunger in the design community to find a better way to “show” design interactions instead of “telling” them. Furthering this trend are large organizations like Airbnb, Evernote, Facebook, Google, and HubSpot. Many of them have been surprisingly benevolent by showing how they’ve started to include prototyping in their product workflows and the practical results of doing so.</p>
<p>The most organized, highest-profile effort in these endeavors has been Facebook’s, through <a href="http://facebook.github.io/origami/">its open-sourcing of Origami</a><sup class="po" id="note-4"><a href="#4">4</a></sup>. A set of tools and extensions built on top of Apple’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/graphicsimaging/conceptual/QuartzComposerUserGuide/qc_concepts/qc_concepts.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40005381-CH212-SW9">Quartz Composer</a><sup class="po" id="note-5"><a href="#5">5</a></sup> (QC), these are the same tools used by the Facebook Creative Labs team that created Paper, Home, Slingshot, and more. Even renowned design firm IDEO released its own tools for QC called <a href="http://labs.ideo.com/2014/05/27/avocado/">Avocado</a><sup class="po" id="note-6"><a href="#6">6</a></sup>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/lesson-4-opt.jpg"><img src="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/lesson-4-preview-opt.jpg" alt="Quartz Composer and Origami in action." title="Quartz Composer and Origami in action." width="500" height="361" /></a><sup class="po" id="note-7"><a href="#7">7</a></sup><br/><em>Quartz Composer and Origami in action. (<a href="http://scotthurff.com/qc">Image credit</a><sup class="po" id="note-8"><a href="#8">8</a></sup>)(<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/lesson-4-opt.jpg">View large version</a><sup class="po" id="note-9"><a href="#9">9</a></sup>)</em></p>
<p>It’s also been a poorly kept secret for some time now that Apple has a set of its own advanced prototyping tools. <a href="https://news.layervault.com/stories/23355-is-facebooks-origami-the-savior-of-quartz-composer">Rumored to be called “Mica,”</a><sup class="po" id="note-10"><a href="#10">10</a></sup> it’s a tool Apple created for its UI designers to craft interactive interfaces more easily. Mica is allegedly Quartz Composer&#8217;s internal replacement, and has been used to create everything from interfaces to Final Cut Pro plugins. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if Mica had a role to play in the creation of iOS 7 and 8.</p>
<h3>That&#8217;s Nice, But What About My Problems?</h3>
<p>You might be thinking that prototyping is just some corporate fad — like something akin to transparent glass whiteboards or Six Sigma. Or it’s something that only elitist organizations with lots of time and money can afford to do. </p>
<p>But here’s the simple truth: prototyping can help all of us who are building mobile products <em>create better products</em>. And if that wasn’t enough, it’ll bring your team together and make your clients — or &#8220;stakeholders,&#8221; if you must use that word — happier, more in the loop, and more apt to buy into what you&#8217;re building.</p>
<p>Sounds like the Holy Grail to me.</p>
<h4>Our Cast of Characters</h4>
<p>It should be pointed out that I was, previously, a prototyping skeptic. I saw it as a frivolous luxury that took my time away from creating pixel-perfect, static mockups.</p>
<p>For years, my process was the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;d create every possible state imaginable in pixel-perfection, and then spend countless words writing out how the app was supposed to work in a narrative format.</li>
<li>Our team would then sit through countless debates about what each of us had envisioned as the &#8220;right&#8221; functionality.</li>
<li>After our debates, we&#8217;d finally sit down to building what we agreed on in our heads. I&#8217;d spend countless hours trying to explain what I actually envisioned for the project&#8217;s interactions once we had something to work with.</li>
</ul>
<p>This process worked for a time. We were building solely for the web with few responsive requirements. But the process became increasingly painful as we started to develop mobile apps. The cost and time required to backtrack after ideas didn&#8217;t pan out created unnecessary sink costs and mental overhead. Because we spent so much time building something, we felt compelled to use it.</p>
<p>We realized there had to be another way. And that&#8217;s when prototyping entered my world. I realized that my inability to move up the chain and contribute to creating the interactions I designed slowed us down. It hindered my team&#8217;s efforts to move quickly and to realize the success or failure of our product decisions faster.</p>
<p>So I set out both to <strong>learn how to prototype and learn where to incorporate it</strong> into my workflow. I also went into the field both to find and to learn from designers who are prototyping veterans: <a href="http://www.stephenmeszaros.com">Steve Meszaros</a><sup class="po" id="note-11"><a href="#11">11</a></sup>, product designer at <a href="http://trywildcard.com">Wildcard</a><sup class="po" id="note-12"><a href="#12">12</a></sup> and <a href="http://paulyting.com">Pauly Ting</a><sup class="po" id="note-13"><a href="#13">13</a></sup>, Head of User Experience for <a href="http://tigerspike.com">Tigerspike</a><sup class="po" id="note-14"><a href="#14">14</a></sup>. </p>
<p>Meszaros works at Wildcard with <a href="http://subtraction.com">Khoi Vinh</a><sup class="po" id="note-15"><a href="#15">15</a></sup>, former design director at the <em>New York Times</em> and named by <em>Fast Company</em> one of the fifty most influential designers in America. With Vinh, Meszaros is responsible for the interface design and interactivity for the not-yet-launched startup, which aims to combine the performance and experience of native apps with the breadth of the entire internet.</p>
<p>Ting is head of user experience at Tigerspike, a design firm that builds apps and mobile sites for Fortune 500 clients, from big-box retailers to internet giants. His work must operate at a massive scale from day one to satisfy not only his clients, but his client’s bosses and his client’s customers. </p>
<p>The following is what I learned about prototyping, both from my own practice and from a number of in-depth interviews with both of them. I&#8217;ll explore the benefits of prototyping and how you can incorporate prototyping into your workflow, <em>today</em>.</p>
<h3>Prototyping: Best Served With A Healthy Dose Of Focus</h3>
<p>Rapid prototyping&#8217;s primary purpose is to focus your already limited time. You’re cutting out fluff, tangents, and feature-creep to bring to life a very specific use case or workflow. Your job is to identify that:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’re building the right thing.</li>
<li>This piece of your product solves the right problem.</li>
<li>This interaction is something your team is capable of building within a reasonable timeframe.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first goal of prototyping is to test, prove, or conceptualize an idea that&#8217;s in your head within a limited timeframe or budget.</p>
<p>“It’s much like a hackathon,” says Ting.</p>
<p>The entire purpose here is to get your ideas out of your head as quickly as possible, and at a fidelity that presents the concepts in your head clearly enough. </p>
<p>All the time and frustration you spend trying to communicate rough interactions can be cut out by simply showing what you mean. A prototype serves as the seed and showcase of your ideas.</p>
<p>Many designers who start prototyping begin by trying to do too much. But the entire purpose of prototyping isn’t to design the interactions of your entire product at once, or to just make pretty things. It’s to demonstrate bite-sized pieces of interaction or specific workflows.</p>
<h3>Choose The Right Tool For The Job</h3>
<p>That being said, a successful prototype speaks directly to its audience. That means that before you start, you need to understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who’s involved in the design process.</li>
<li>Who needs to be able to use it and provide feedback.</li>
<li>How soon it must be delivered.</li>
<li>The complexity of the idea you need to communicate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on how these factors are configured, a prototype can take on different forms. You might, for example, be able to get away with an unpolished, ugly, hacked-up HTML and CSS combo. Or sketches and wireframes might do. But in some cases, you&#8217;ll need to create more polished, accessible prototypes to really understand if an interaction will work.</p>
<p>If you’re on a product team and developing or refining new features, your job is to determine the product and features your team needs to build. You need to understand, define and communicate this as quickly and as thoroughly as you can. The product you define and design must solve the right problem and be something your team is capable of building within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
<p>Start by understanding the purpose of the product you&#8217;re building. Never lose sight of that as you move through the process. You also need to be aware of the team involved (whether it&#8217;s yours or includes a client), the timeframe, and the required deliverables.</p>
<p>“A prototype can serve many purposes. It can be just for demonstrating an idea, it can be for exploring and testing an idea, it can be for selling an idea, or it can be to build an MVP,” says Ting.</p>
<p>If you need to prototype a user flow, make sure that it tells a story. This can be more powerful than simply prototyping a single interaction, since single interactions are best understood by dedicated product teams. They&#8217;ll better understand where in the flow the interaction sits, how it&#8217;s different than any existing interactions, and how it will make an improvement.</p>
<p>Consequently, prototyping a single flow helps anybody using the prototype become more emotionally connected to the product. It enables one to get lost in the experience and better illustrates any differences or improvements to old or competitive flows.</p>
<p>These factors determine the tools you should choose to build your prototype. Overall, you should stick to this rule of thumb: if most of the time you spend prototyping is using the tool itself versus on the thought behind the design, you may be using the wrong tool for the job.</p>
<h4>Prototyping Tools in Action: An Example Using InVision</h4>
<p>Meszaros, Ting, and myself have Quartz Composer/Origami and <a href="http://framerjs.com/">Framer.js</a><sup class="po" id="note-16"><a href="#16">16</a></sup> in our prototyping toolboxes. Lately, though, Ting has found that he throws down basic user flows first with <a href="http://www.invisionapp.com/">InVision</a><sup class="po" id="note-17"><a href="#17">17</a></sup>, then homes in on specific interactions when necessary.</p>
<p>“InVision is my first go-to prototyping tool, largely because it’s so fast and simple to set up, with the added benefit of being able to share it seamlessly,” says Ting. “It requires no technical knowledge, which means when working with non-technical stakeholders, there’s an easy and low barrier for them to collaborate, participate, and more constructively contribute to the design process. It’s easily the fastest tool to use to create a polished-feeling experience.”</p>
<p>InVision can help piece together a series of static mockups quickly, providing somebody without technical knowledge the feeling of actually moving between screens. It can immerse people inside or outside your organization in the product, quickly selling an idea with basic segues and transitions.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of an InVision prototype Ting used to win a hackathon put on by the rental car giant Hertz. Ting’s task was to come up with a product strategy for what a “connected car” experience could look like for Hertz customers. Within 24 hours, Ting’s team of three researched the use case, created user stories, and constructed the prototype.</p>
<p><a href="http://provide.smashingmagazine.com/hertz.gif"><img src="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/hertz-preview-opt.jpg" alt="Pauly Ting's prototype for a Hertz Gold mobile app." title="Pauly Ting's prototype for a Hertz Gold mobile app." width="500" height="408" /></a><sup class="po" id="note-18"><a href="#18">18</a></sup><br/><em>Pauly Ting&#8217;s prototype for a Hertz Gold mobile app. Built with InVision. (<a href="http://paulyting.com/">Image credit</a><sup class="po" id="note-19"><a href="#19">19</a></sup>, see <a href="http://provide.smashingmagazine.com/hertz.gif">GIF</a><sup class="po" id="note-20"><a href="#20">20</a></sup>)</em></p>
<p>With this prototype, Ting was able to tell a story about how a mobile app could improve the overall experience of renting a car. It included real-world experiences typically faced by rental car customers, and prototyped how push notifications, GPS navigation, and in-app commerce could be combined to create a compelling flow.</p>

<p><script src="//fast.wistia.net/assets/external/iframe-api-v1.js"></script></p>
<h4>The Power of Advanced Prototyping Tools</h4>
<p>Limited to basic transitions and animations, InVision trades personality for expediency. More advanced tools like Quartz Composer or Framer.js could unlock interactions you otherwise wouldn’t be able to represent with InVision. These tools, while sometimes difficult to adopt, are the key to creating wholly original interactions tailored to your product and visual style.</p>
<p>“Prototyping [with advanced tools] has taught me more about design and usability than I had imagined,” says Meszaros. “It&#8217;s a fun way to learn a new language or application and is critical to building and articulating interaction. I’d recommend taking an hour a day to play with a new prototyping application or language such as Framer.js. Download example files off GitHub and dissect them, tweak them, adjust them.”</p>
<p>Advanced prototyping tools like Quartz Composer are almost a requirement for you to create interactions and animations that have never before been seen. And they&#8217;re a must if you need fine-grained control over every aspect of your creation.</p>
<p>In my own experience, getting through the initial learning curve of Quartz Composer and Origami wasn&#8217;t the epic struggle it&#8217;s been advertised to be. After only a few hours, I was able to create complete flows with wholly original interactions and present them to my team for testing, feedback, a few iterations, and implementation in Xcode. It was both creatively satisfying and expedient, as it saved my team countless hours of vague back-and-forth to get interactions and animation timing exactly right.</p>
<p>To neutralize this perceived learning curve, I <a href="http://scotthurff.com/qc">co-created a video crash course</a><sup class="po" id="note-22"><a href="#22">22</a></sup> that specifically helps mobile designers master the basics of Quartz Composer and Origami in five days or less. You can start creating prototypes right away at your own pace. Jay Thrash also has a <a href="http://vimeo.com/85578380">great series of videos</a><sup class="po" id="note-23"><a href="#23">23</a></sup> for Quartz Composer beginners, and I&#8217;ve also enjoyed the <a href="http://qc.prabros.com/primer1.html">work of the Pra Brothers</a><sup class="po" id="note-24"><a href="#24">24</a></sup>.</p>
<h3>Test Your Prototype As Soon As Possible</h3>
<p>Once the prototype is ready for consumption, it should immediately be used to drive discussion toward the eventual decision about how to proceed.</p>
<p>Beyond speed, this is another huge benefit of prototyping. It allows for greater buy-in across your organization and even among your clients. The prototype becomes a common language that can be experienced and understood by everyone.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s here that your goal is to understand where your interaction or flow falls short. What parts are implausible to build or too over-the-top? Where do people get confused? What parts could use more personality or ingenuity? How could these changes inform other parts of your product? Get it in front of your developers, decision makers, customers and clients and you&#8217;ll have quick answers to these questions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Visualizing [and experiencing] interactions allows us to have more constructive conversations with the larger team,&#8221; says Meszaros. &#8220;Prototypes have been instrumental in bringing together and facilitating feedback across all areas of the team from strategy, to engineering and design. By developing prototypes, we have greater control of our consequences. At Wildcard, discovering whether or not a build may be expensive is critical to staying on target,” he continues. “That’s why I strongly advocate designing and prototyping in context whenever possible. I find it best to build with all attributes of the UI in place as it would be in the final product.&#8221;</p>
<h4>Prototyping in Action: A Example from Wildcard</h4>
<p>To illustrate this, let’s look at a prototype Meszaros built for Wildcard using Quartz Composer and Origami. This also happens to be the first time the company has released anything to the public about how the Wildcard product looks and works.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an early example of what we built with Quartz Composer and Origami while defining our interaction paradigms,” says Meszaros. “The prototype highlights a key problem: notice that the old &#8216;cards&#8217; transition by falling off of the screen, while new cards &#8216;spawn&#8217; from beneath the parent card.” </p>
<p><a href="http://provide.smashingmagazine.com/wildcard.gif"><img src="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/wildcard-preview-opt.jpg" alt="One of many prototypes built by Stephen Meszaros to fine-tune how old content is dismissed and new content loaded in Wildcard." title="One of many prototypes built by Stephen Meszaros to fine-tune how old content is dismissed and new content loaded in Wildcard." width="500" height="393" /></a><sup class="po" id="note-25"><a href="#25">25</a></sup><br/><em>One of many prototypes built by Stephen Meszaros to fine-tune how old content is dismissed and new content loaded in Wildcard. (<a href="http://www.stephenmeszaros.com/">Image credit</a><sup class="po" id="note-26"><a href="#26">26</a></sup>, see <a href="http://provide.smashingmagazine.com/wildcard.gif">GIF</a><sup class="po" id="note-27"><a href="#27">27</a></sup>)</em></p>
<p>“It quickly became apparent [in user testing] that this may confuse someone as to the location of the old cards. Some questions we asked ourselves were &#8216;where do I find my old cards?&#8217; &#8216;Are they lower on the screen?&#8217; and the like. With this, we were able to identify some key concerns in developing this prototype and quickly built alternative prototypes with more confidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>This confusion was uncovered in one of Wildcard’s prototype review sessions, led by Meszaros and Vinh.</p>
<p>This small example highlights the importance of taking the time to perform unbiased user tests with the prototypes you&#8217;ve built. It&#8217;s not enough to create a prototype and informally perform over-the-shoulder review sessions. Prototypes require dedicated segments of time with potential customers, your clients, and team members to see how they respond.</p>
<p>After each session is over, take notes about how you can improve the prototype while it&#8217;s fresh in your mind. Sometimes, the problems identified in a prototype can even be remedied within minutes or seconds by making on-the-fly changes. The effect of this speed is immeasurable, because it affects so many areas of the organization — it increases the creativity and originality of a designer, it prevents code from being wasted (and, subsequently, keeps the code base cleaner), it unifies the team, and it brings the product closer to what your customers actually want.</p>
<h4>A Typical Timeframe</h4>
<p>So how long should the typical prototyping cycle take? On average, the three of us found that the entire loop of prototype creation, testing, iteration, and readying for implementation took about a week. The most each of us had seen was two weeks &mdash; mostly due to communication lulls.</p>
<p>One to two weeks allows enough time to come up with ideas and deliver them without fluff, tangents, or politics. It&#8217;s a forcing function to prevent wasted cycles. But it’s long enough to stop, breathe, and be able to make smart decisions. </p>
<p>But it&#8217;s important to note that there&#8217;s no defined scale for this time period. That&#8217;s to say, we&#8217;ve each been able to prototype everything from a very specific effect (i.e. the effect a user sees when a camera takes a photo), a user flow (how a user sends another user a photo), to the basics of how an entire app works. The scope depends on the level of polish you need, what phase of development you&#8217;re in, and who the audience is. Remember, though, that the longer the &#8220;sprint,&#8221; the more difficult it becomes to maintain momentum.</p>
<p>For many small product teams, the typical turnaround of this process could be as fast as a a typical business day.</p>
<p>“The biggest thing I’ve learned about rapid prototyping is that it&#8217;s a great equalizer,” said Ting. “Using tools like InVision or Quartz Composer really puts the onus on UI, UX, PMs, and engineers to understand each other&#8217;s disciplines and thus work together. We&#8217;ve had little conflict, everyone feels informed and it&#8217;s very organic in feeling. Rapid prototyping allows that. It&#8217;s not just a tool or even a methodology, it&#8217;s a culture.”</p>
<h3>Ensuring A Repeatable Process</h3>
<p>Once the prototype has been vetted by your team and, ideally, your customers or clients, it’s your job to make it easy for an engineer to implement. </p>
<p>Depending on your tools of choice, this can take many forms. For some, it might be just handing off code you wrote in Framer.js, or sharing your <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/RoadMapiOS/SecondTutorial.html">Xcode Storyboards</a><sup class="po" id="note-28"><a href="#28">28</a></sup>. It doesn’t matter if your code is messy &mdash; it only matters that your developers know the experience you’re trying to achieve, the logic required to get there, and specific values for timing, speed, bounciness, tap areas, and other particulars.</p>
<p>If you used Quartz Composer and Origami, share your composition files and extract key values, such as transition and animation timing. Include the type of easing curve, such as “Quadratic In-Out,” if applicable. Providing as much information up front about how to implement your ideas will increase the speed at which you can ship your product.</p>
<p>Bleed as much into the development process as you can, and hone this skill over time. The amount of effort and care you invest in this handoff phase will have a direct effect on your organizaton&#8217;s process. Since it makes it easier on your engineering team to implement your ideas, it&#8217;ll help to solidify prototyping as a staple of your development efforts.</p>
<p>Weaving prototyping into your process may seem daunting if there are many separate teams handling pieces of the app&#8217;s design. You might, for example, have separate user interface and wireframing teams. Remember that for prototyping to be successful, it has to be an inclusive &mdash; and highly-collaborative &mdash; process. Wherever possible, separate teams need to work side-by-side to eliminate the rudimentary boundaries of departments and even physical space.</p>
<p>In the end, prototyping brings everybody who&#8217;s involved in the process of building a product closer to the end goal: making something that your customer wants. Embracing this means changing how your team works.</p>
<h4>A Challenge: Approach Your Design Goals from Now On with a Prototyping Mind</h4>
<p>In the end, you’ll be amazed at what you can accomplish through prototyping. Not only is it a great unifier for your team and your customers, it builds excitement for what you’re building and makes everyone feel like they&#8217;re a part of the design process. It brings joy and momentum to design reviews. And it helps your team make better decisions.</p>
<p>“Prototyping helps us to make more deliberate and calculated decisions as a group, and that is what may be most important aspect of prototyping,” says Meszaros. “It&#8217;s an engaging way to review new features or updates and brings a bit of joy to our design reviews. Don&#8217;t be intimidated to prototype, you&#8217;ll be amazed by what you can accomplish.”</p>
<p>But perhaps the most powerful side effect is that it can make you a better designer. You’ll become both more productive <em>and</em> more creative. When you’re building rapid prototypes, you begin to create feedback loops that improve your designs. You’ll stumble upon ideas as you work through the core problem you’re trying to solve. </p>
<p>“There are regular situations where I would literally change a design in front of everyone mid-discussion and ask, ‘is that what you mean?’” recalls Ting. “And then we’d test and discuss that. It saved hours and days of emails, meetings, side conversations, politics and debate.”</p>
<h4>Next Steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Learn a prototyping tool, ideally one that you can use to create designs meant for touch manipulation, like <a href="http://scotthurff.com/qc">Quartz Composer</a><sup class="po" id="note-29"><a href="#29">29</a></sup> or Framer.js. You&#8217;ll be investing in your own future.</li>
<li>Spend time hanging out in communities &mdash; online or offline &mdash; where you can learn from others with more prototyping experience. Understand their common struggles, how they&#8217;ve tackled them, and learn how they stay fresh. <a href="http://qcdesigners.com">QC Designers</a><sup class="po" id="note-30"><a href="#30">30</a></sup> is one of my go-to communities for Quartz Composer questions.</li>
<li>Collect videos (I use <a href="http://www.airsquirrels.com/reflector/">Reflector</a><sup class="po" id="note-31"><a href="#31">31</a></sup>) or animated GIFs of app interactions that you like. Replicate them with your new prototyping skills.</li>
<li>Set a date for when you want to start using interactive prototypes in your daily work. Present to key co-workers and let them manipulate your designs on their own. Smile when they have a look of amazement on their face.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having addressed the <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/12/03/efficiently-simplifying-navigation-information-architecture/">information architecture</a><sup class="po" id="note-1"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> and the <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/05/09/efficiently-simplifying-navigation-systems/">various systems</a><sup class="po" id="note-2"><a href="#2">2</a></sup> of navigation in the first two articles of this series, the last step is to efficiently simplify the navigation experience &mdash; specifically, by carefully designing interaction with the navigation menu.</p>
<p>When designing interaction with any type of navigation menu, we have to consider the following six aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>symbols,</li>
<li>target areas,</li>
<li>interaction event,</li>
<li>layout,</li>
<li>levels,</li>
<li>functional context.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible to design these aspects in different ways. Designers often <a title="Creative and innovative navigation designs" href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/07/11/innovative-navigation-designs/">experiment with new techniques</a><sup class="po" id="note-3"><a href="#3">3</a></sup> to create a more exciting navigation experience. And looking for new, more engaging solutions is a very good thing. However, most users just want to get to the content with as little fuss as possible. For those users, designing the aforementioned aspects to be as <strong>simple, predictable and comfortable</strong> as possible is important.</p>
<h3>Symbols</h3>
<p>Users often rely on small visual clues, such as icons and symbols, to guide them through a website’s interface. Creating a system of symbolic communication throughout the website that is <strong>unambiguous and consistent</strong> is important.</p>
<p>The first principle in designing a drop-down navigation menu is to make users aware that it exists in the first place.</p>
<h4>The Triangle Symbol</h4>
<p>A downward triangle next to the corresponding menu label is the most familiar way to indicate a drop-down menu and distinguish it from regular links.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/1-large-opt.jpg"><img src="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/1-preview-opt.jpg" alt="1-preview-opt" width="500" height="408" /></a><sup class="po" id="note-4"><a href="#4">4</a></sup><br/><em>A downward triangle next to the menu label is the most reliable way to indicate a drop-down. (Source: <a href="http://www.cbs.com/shows/bad-teacher/">CBS</a><sup class="po" id="note-5"><a href="#5">5</a></sup>) (<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/1-large-opt.jpg">View large version</a><sup class="po" id="note-6"><a href="#6">6</a></sup>)</em></p>
<p>If a menu flies out, rather than drops down, then the triangle or arrow should point in the right direction. The website below is exemplary because it also takes into account the available margin and adjusts the direction in which the menu unfolds accordingly.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/2-large-opt.jpg"><img src="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/2-preview-opt.jpg" alt="2-preview-opt" width="500" height="377" /></a><sup class="po" id="note-7"><a href="#7">7</a></sup><br/><em>A triangle or arrow pointing in the right direction is the most reliable way to indicate a fly-out menu. (Source: <a href="http://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/index.html">Currys</a><sup class="po" id="note-8"><a href="#8">8</a></sup>) (<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/2-large-opt.jpg">View large version</a><sup class="po" id="note-9"><a href="#9">9</a></sup>)</em></p>
<h4>The Plus Symbol</h4>
<p>Another symbol that is used for opening menus is the plus symbol (“+”). Notice that the website below mixes symbols: an arrow for the top navigation menu and a “+” for the dynamic navigation menu to the left (although an arrow is used to further expand the dynamic menu &mdash; for example, to show “More sports”).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/3-large-opt.jpg"><img src="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/3-preview-opt.jpg" alt="3-preview-opt" width="500" height="374" /></a><sup class="po" id="note-10"><a href="#10">10</a></sup><br/><em>Some websites use a “+” to drop down or fly out menus. (Source: <a href="http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/">Nike</a><sup class="po" id="note-11"><a href="#11">11</a></sup>) (<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/3-large-opt.jpg">View large version</a><sup class="po" id="note-12"><a href="#12">12</a></sup>)</em></p>
<p>Mixing symbols can be problematic, as we’ll see below. So, if you ever add functionality that enables users to add something (such as an image, a cart or a playlist), then “+” would not be ideal for dropping down or flying out a menu because it typically represents adding something.</p>
<h4>The Three-Line Symbol</h4>
<p>A third symbol often used to indicate a navigation menu, especially on responsive websites, is three horizontal lines.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/4-large-opt.png"><img src="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/4-preview-opt.png" alt="4-preview-opt" width="500" height="48" /></a><sup class="po" id="note-13"><a href="#13">13</a></sup><br/><em>Three horizontal lines is frequently used for responsive navigation menus. (Source: <a href="http://nokia.com">Nokia</a><sup class="po" id="note-14"><a href="#14">14</a></sup>) (<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/4-large-opt.png">View large version</a><sup class="po" id="note-15"><a href="#15">15</a></sup>)</em></p>
<p>Note a couple of things. First, three lines, like a <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/grid.jpg">grid</a><sup class="po" id="note-16"><a href="#16">16</a></sup> and a <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/bullet_list.jpg">bullet list</a><sup class="po" id="note-17"><a href="#17">17</a></sup> icon, communicate a certain type of layout &mdash; specifically, a vertical stack of entries. The menu’s layout should be consistent with the layout that the icon implies. The website below, for example, lists items horizontally, thus contradicting the layout indicated by the menu symbol.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/5-large-opt.jpg"><img src="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/5-preview-opt.jpg" alt="5-preview-opt" width="500" height="296" /></a><sup class="po" id="note-18"><a href="#18">18</a></sup><br/><em>Three lines do not work well if the menu items are not stacked vertically. (Source: <a href="http://2012.dconstruct.org">dConstruct 2012</a><sup class="po" id="note-19"><a href="#19">19</a></sup>) (<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/5-large-opt.jpg">View large version</a><sup class="po" id="note-20"><a href="#20">20</a></sup>)</em></p>
<p>The advantage of the more inclusive triangle symbol and the label “Menu” is that they suit any layout, allowing you to change the layout without having to change the icon.</p>
<p>Secondly, even though three lines are becoming more common, the symbol is still relatively new, and it is more ambiguous, possibly representing more than just a navigation menu. Therefore, a label would clarify its purpose for many users.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/6-large-opt.jpg"><img src="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/6-preview-opt.jpg" alt="6-preview-opt" width="500" height="58" /></a><sup class="po" id="note-21"><a href="#21">21</a></sup><br/><em>An accompanying label would clarify the purpose of the three lines. (Source: <a href="http://kiwibank.co.nz/">Kiwibank</a><sup class="po" id="note-22"><a href="#22">22</a></sup>) (<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/6-large-opt.jpg">View large version</a><sup class="po" id="note-23"><a href="#23">23</a></sup>)</em></p>
<h4>Consistent Use Of Symbols</h4>
<p>While finding symbols that accurately represent an element or task is important, also carefully plan their usage throughout the website to create a consistent appearance and avoid confusion.</p>
<p>Notice the inconsistent use of symbols in the screenshot below. The three lines in the upper-right corner drop down the navigation menu. The three lines in the center indicate “View nutrition info.” The “Location” selector uses a downward triangle, while the “Drinks” and “Food” menus, which drop down as well, use a “+” symbol.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/7-large-opt.png"><img alt="consistent_symbols" src="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/7-preview-opt.png" width="500" height="534" /></a><sup class="po" id="note-24"><a href="#24">24</a></sup><br/><em>Inconsistent symbols lead to confusion.

<p>While using multiple symbols for a drop-down menu is inconsistent, using arrows for anything other than a drop-down menu causes problems, too. As seen below, all options load a new page, rather than fly out or drop down a menu.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/8-large-opt.png"><img alt="arrow" src="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/8-preview-opt.png" width="500" height="401" /></a><sup class="po" id="note-27"><a href="#27">27</a></sup><br/><em>Using a triangle or arrow for anything other than a drop-down or fly-out menu can cause confusion. (Source: <a href="http://www.baristaprima.ca/">Barista Prima</a><sup class="po" id="note-28"><a href="#28">28</a></sup>) (<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/8-large-opt.png">View large version</a><sup class="po" id="note-29"><a href="#29">29</a></sup>)</a></em></p>
<p>This leads to a couple of problems. First, using arrows for regular links &mdash; whether to <a href="http://baymard.com/blog/ux-illusion-of-space">create the illusion of space</a><sup class="po" id="note-30"><a href="#30">30</a></sup> or for other reasons &mdash; puts pressure on you to consistently do the same for all links. Otherwise, users could be surprised, not knowing when to expect a link to load a simple menu or a new page altogether. Secondly, a single-level item, such as “Products”, could conceivably be expanded with subcategories in the future. A triangle could then be added to indicate this and distinguish it from single-level entries, such as the “About” item.</p>
<p>Users generally interpret an arrow to indicate a drop-down or fly-out menu. And they don’t have any problem following a link with no arrow, as long as it looks clickable. It is best not to mix these two concepts.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What is a product manager? What do product managers do all day? Most importantly, why do companies need to hire them? Good questions.</p>
<p>The first confusion we have to clear up is what we mean by “product.” In the context of software development, a product is the website, application or online service that users interact with. Depending on the size of the company and its products, a product manager could be responsible for an entire system (such as a mobile app) or part of a system (such as the checkout flow on an e-commerce website across all devices).</p>
<p>This is confusing because, in most contexts, a product is a thing you sell to people. Particularly in e-commerce, product managers often get confused with category managers, which are the team that sources and merchandises the products sold on an e-commerce website. So, yes, “product” probably isn’t the best word for it. But it’s what we’ve got, and it’s the word we’ll refer to in exploring this role.</p>
<p>To define the role of a product manager, let’s start by looking at Marc Andreessen’s view of the <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee204/ProductMarketFit.html">only thing that matters in a startup</a><sup class="po" id="note-1"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The quality of a startup’s <strong>product</strong> can be defined as how impressive the product is to one customer or user who actually uses it: How easy is the product to use? How feature rich is it? How fast is it? How extensible is it? How polished is it? How many (or rather, how few) bugs does it have?</p>
<p>The size of a startup’s <strong>market</strong> is the the number, and growth rate, of those customers or users for that product.…</p>
<p>The only thing that matters is getting to product-market fit. Product-market fit means being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even though Andreessen wrote this for startups, the importance of that last sentence about product-market fit holds truth for every organization &mdash; whether the organization is getting a new product to market or redesigning an existing experience or anything in between. It is a universal road map to success, and it is the core of what product managers are responsible for.</p>
<p>With that as the backdrop, my definition of the role of a product manager would be <strong>to achieve business success by meeting user needs through the continual planning and execution of digital product solutions</strong>.</p>
<p>This definition summarizes all of the things that a product manager needs to obsess over: the target market, the intricacies of the product, what the business needs in order to succeed, and how to measure that success. It also encapsulates the three things that a product manager should never lose sight of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ultimate measure of success is the health of the business and, therefore, the value that the product provides to users.</li>
<li>Everything starts with a solid understanding of the target market and its needs, so that the focus remains on the quality of the product experience.</li>
<li>A continual cycle of planning and execution is required to meet these market needs in a sustainable way.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, how does this translate to what a product manager does every day? That question is way too big to answer here, but as an introduction, Marty Cagan has a great list of common tasks that product managers are responsible for in his ebook <a href="http://www.svpg.com/assets/Files/productmanager.pdf"><em>Behind Every Great Product</em></a><sup class="po" id="note-2"><a href="#2">2</a></sup> (PDF). The tasks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>identifying and assessing the validity and feasibility of product opportunities,</li>
<li>making sure the right product is delivered at the right time,</li>
<li>developing a product strategy and road map for development,</li>
<li>leading the team in executing the product’s road map,</li>
<li>evangelizing the product internally to the executive team and colleagues,</li>
<li>representing customers through the product development process.</li>
</ul>
<p>But before a product manager is able to do these things, a couple of awkward questions have to be asked. First, do companies <em>really</em> need product managers? And, if we can agree on that, what are the characteristics of a good one? Also, where does this role fit in an organization’s structure? Let’s explore these questions.</p>
<h3>Why Companies Need Product Managers</h3>
<p>The role of product manager can be a hard sell for some companies. Common objections to it include:</p>
<ul>
<li>“We have various people in the organization whose roles fulfill each of these functions.”</li>
<li>“I don’t see how the role would make us more money.”</li>
<li>“Product managers would just slow us down.”</li>
<li>“I don’t want to relinquish control of the product to someone else.” (OK, this one is not usually said out loud.)</li>
</ul>
<p>These appear to be valid concerns, but only if the role is not well understood &mdash; or if the organization has bad product managers who perpetuate these perceptions.</p>
<p>The truth is that, to be effective, the role of a manager for a particular product or area must not be filled by multiple people. It is essential for the product manager to see the whole picture &mdash; the strategic vision as well as the details of implementation &mdash; in order to make good decisions about the product. If knowledge of different parts of the process resides in the heads of different people, then no one will have that holistic view, and all value will be drained of the role.</p>
<p>Let’s look at two major benefits that product managers bring.</p>
<h4>Product Managers Ensure a Market-Driven Approach</h4>
<p>The key argument in favor of product managers is that they help companies to be driven by the needs and goals of the target market, not the forces of technology or fads. As Barbara Nelson puts it in “<a href="http://www.pragmaticmarketing.com/resources/who-needs-product-management">Who Needs Product Management?”</a><sup class="po" id="note-3"><a href="#3">3</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is vastly easier to identify market problems and solve them with technology than it is to find buyers for your existing technology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If done right, a market-driven focus results in long-term, sustainable, profitable business, because the company will remain focused on solving market problems, as opposed to looking for things to do with the latest technologies. A market-driven focus is important because companies that have one are proven to be more profitable than those driven by other factors (31% more profitable, <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/1252267">according to George S. Day and Prakash Nedungadi</a><sup class="po" id="note-4"><a href="#4">4</a></sup>).</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean focusing on incremental change to the exclusion of product innovation. Identifying market problems is about not only finding existing issues to improve (for example, “60% of users drop off on this page, so let’s fix that”), but also about creating new products to satisfy unmet needs (“Cell phones suck &mdash; let’s make a better one”).</p>
<h4>Product Managers Improve Time-to-Everything</h4>
<p>The second major benefit of product managers is that they reduce the time an organization takes to reach its goals. A well-defined and appropriate product development process run by effective managers will improve both the time-to-market as well as the time-to-revenue.</p>
<p>The reason for the faster turnaround time is that a product manager is responsible for figuring out what’s worth building and what’s not. This means less time spent on the spaghetti approach to product development (throwing things against the wall to see what sticks) and more time spent on building products that have been validated in the market. This approach also sharpens the organization’s focus, enabling the organization to dedicate more people to products that are likely to succeed, instead of spreading people too thin on projects that no one is sure will have a product-market fit.</p>

<h4>User Experience</h4>
<p>Immediately after you register, which takes about a minute, a simple wizard helps you to get started with your first project in three simple steps: enter a website address, install the extension for capturing high-quality screenshots, and invite colleagues to collaborate on the project. The website that you add then opens in a new tab, and you can start commenting right on the web page by selecting and dragging the mouse wherever you notice a bug. You can appoint a colleague to fix the issue and assign a priority to the task.</p>

<p>TrackDuck currently integrates with only a couple of systems: JIRA and Basecamp. The integration works both ways &mdash; tasks are sent and updated automatically in both systems, no double entry required.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Unlimited number of team members</li>
<li>Cross-browser</li>
<li>Technical details are collected automatically</li>
<li>Real time with WebSockets</li>
<li>No extensions needed</li>
<li>Anonymous feedback allowed</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Extension required to capture high-quality screenshots</li>
<li>Few systems to integrate with</li>
</ul>
<h4>Third-Party Integration</h4>
<ul>
<li>Basecamp (both ways)</li>
<li>JIRA (both ways)</li>
<li>WordPress plugin</li>
<li>Modx plugin</li>
</ul>
<h4>Supported Browsers</h4>
<ul>
<li>Chrome</li>
<li>Internet Explorer</li>
<li>Safari</li>
<li>Firefox</li>
<li>bookmarklet (for other browsers)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pricing</h4>
<p>You can get a free 14-day trial of the fully functional version. The free version allows for one project and unlimited contributors. Paid subscription plans start at $19 per month. Custom enterprise plans are also available.</p>
<h3>BugMuncher</h3>
<p><a href="http://bugmuncher.com">Bugmuncher</a><sup class="po" id="note-8"><a href="#8">8</a></sup> is a handy web application allows you to highlight problems on a website. Users can make notes on specific areas of a website where they notice issues. BugMuncher will automatically take a screenshot of the area where the highlight was made and send it to you.</p>
<figure><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/08-bugmuncher-opt.jpg"><img src="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/08-bugmuncher-opt-500.jpg" alt="BugMuncher" width="500" height="336" /></a><sup class="po" id="note-9"><a href="#9">9</a></sup><figcaption>BugMuncher allows you to highlight problems on a website.</figcaption></figure>
<h4>User Experience</h4>
<p>Installing and getting started with BugMuncher isn’t complicated. All you have to do is embed the code on your website. Anyone who has ever set up Google Analytics could handle it. There is no onboarding tour, which could be a problem for inexperienced users. Also, when you embed the code on your website, a small shortcut appears for all visitors to the page, allowing them to highlight or (if they need to hide personal data) to black out certain parts of the page. However, you cannot add separate text comments to the web page.</p>
<figure><img src="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/09-bugmuncher-opt.jpg" alt="All tasks and bug reports are available in the dashboard" width="201" height="193" /><figcaption>All tasks and bug reports are available in the dashboard. Issues are also visible as pins on the web page itself.</figcaption></figure>
<p>When testing this tool, I couldn’t scroll down the page and was confined to working within the visible area, which is a bit odd.</p>
<p>After you have highlighted an area of the page, you will be prompted to enter your email address, describe the bugs you’ve found and submit them. You can access all reports, configure email alerts and set up integration in the dashboard.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Cross-browser</li>
<li>Automatically attaches technical details</li>
<li>No extension needed</li>
<li>Allows for anonymous feedback</li>
<li>Supports Internet Explorer down to version 7</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Not real time</li>
<li>Cannot select a particular area of a page</li>
<li>No way to comment on dynamic elements on the page</li>
</ul>
<h4>Third-Party Integration</h4>
<ul>
<li>GitHub</li>
<li>activeCollab</li>
<li>Bitbucket</li>
<li>Trello</li>
<li>Zendesk</li>
</ul>
<h4>Supported Browsers</h4>
<ul>
<li>Chrome</li>
<li>FireFox</li>
<li>Safari</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pricing</h4>
<p>A free 30-day trial is available. After that, pricing starts at $19 per month for a personal subscription with one account. There is no limit to how many team members can use BugMuncher; the profile limit refers to separate &#8216;buckets&#8217; of feedback reports, and different notification options &mdash; available for $99 per month.</p>
<h3>BugHerd</h3>
<p><a href="http://bugherd.com">BugHerd</a><sup class="po" id="note-10"><a href="#10">10</a></sup> is a simple bug-tracking and collaboration tool for web designers and their clients. It allows users to flag issues on web pages using a simple point-and-click interface and to submit reports of problems.</p>
<figure><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/10-bugherd-opt.jpg"><img src="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/10-bugherd-opt-500.jpg" alt="BugHerd Main Page" width="500" height="359" /></a><sup class="po" id="note-11"><a href="#11">11</a></sup><figcaption>BugHerd allows users to flag issues using a simple point-and-click interface and to submit reports of problems. (<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/10-bugherd-opt.jpg">View large version</a><sup class="po" id="note-12"><a href="#12">12</a></sup>)</figcaption></figure>
<h4>User Experience</h4>
<p>You don’t need a credit card to sign up. Registration is pretty simple: You can try the tool by installing a browser extension or by adding JavaScript code to your website. Once you’ve done one of these two things, you’ll be able to add websites to work with. Don’t forget to include the <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code>, or else it won’t work.</p>
<p>After completing the short onboarding process, you’ll be all set and can pin issues and bugs directly to web pages. You can’t highlight random areas of the page; the tool is tied to DOM elements &mdash; a useful but questionable solution. We particularly had problems selecting big areas of the page.</p>
<p>While not a major issue, the indicator can be hard to notice on light and gray backgrounds, so you might have to refer to the task list to find it sometimes.</p>
<p>Another drawback is the size and location of the side panel, which occupies a big part of the page, hiding your pins and most of the page.</p>
<figure><img src="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/11-bugherd-opt.jpg" alt="The side panel is a bit too big" width="500" height="234" /><figcaption>The side panel is a bit too big.</figcaption></figure>
<p>BugHerd offers quite a lot of integration (we tried Basecamp and JIRA). Unfortunately, integration seems to work only one way for now &mdash; tasks created in Bugherd are sent to Basecamp, but if you update them directly in Basecamp, you won’t be notified of the changes in Bugherd.</p>
<figure><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/12-bugherd-toolbar-opt.jpg"><img src="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/12-bugherd-toolbar-opt.jpg" alt="Bugherd toolbar" width="471" height="401" /></a><sup class="po" id="note-13"><a href="#13">13</a></sup><figcaption>Bugherd’s toolbar.

<p>Overall, the product is very good. The UX is questionable in places &mdash; as mentioned, the side panel is just too big. Prices are a little steep, too; prepare to pay almost $100 for a team of five.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Highlight bugs directly on the web page</li>
<li>Anonymous comments allowed</li>
<li>Screenshot automatically sent with every bug report</li>
<li>A lot of third-party integration</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Sidebar is too big</li>
<li>Integration with third-party systems is one way</li>
<li>Quite expensive</li>
<li>Extension required to capture screenshots</li>
<li>Expensive for teams</li>
</ul>
<h4>Third-Party Integration</h4>
<ul>
<li>JIRA</li>
<li>Basecamp</li>
<li>GitHub</li>
<li>Redmine</li>
<li>Zendesk</li>
<li>Pivotal Tracker</li>
</ul>
<h4>Supported Browsers</h4>
<ul>
<li>Chrome</li>
<li>FireFox</li>
<li>Safari</li>
<li>Internet Explorer</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pricing</h4>
<p>Pricing starts at $19 per month. A short free trial is available, after which you’ll have to pay for each user on the account.</p>
<h3>Notable</h3>
<p><a href="http://notableapp.com">Notable</a><sup class="po" id="note-23"><a href="#23">23</a></sup><sup class="po" id="note-15"><a href="#15">15</a></sup> is a web-based application for sharing feedback on images, mockups and live website designs. The user takes a screenshot of any interface, draws a box around the area they want to comment on and then types in their feedback.</p>
<figure><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/13-notable-opt.jpg"><img src="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/13-notable-opt-500.jpg" alt="Notable Main Page" width="500" height="336" /></a><sup class="po" id="note-16"><a href="#16">16</a></sup><figcaption>Notable is a web-based application for sharing feedback on images, mockups and live website designs.</figcaption></figure>
<h4>User Experience</h4>
<p>You start the registration process by entering your payment details, even if you’ve selected a trial account. If you want to skip this step, then you just have to watch a demo video of the service on YouTube and then install the required extension. Then, when you click the extension’s icon, the app automatically takes a screenshot and uploads it to the server. After the upload, you are redirected to the saved screenshot, where you can highlight any area and add comments.</p>
<figure><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/14-notable-opt.jpg"><img src="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/14-notable-opt-500.jpg" alt="Notable in action" width="500" height="210" /></a><sup class="po" id="note-17"><a href="#17">17</a></sup><figcaption>Notable in action.

<p>It also saves HTML and CSS from the page, including meta tags, in text format. This separation of code, styles and images seems less useful than BugHerd and TrackDuck’s method, but it might appeal to some users.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Export custom PDFs</li>
<li>Unlimited team members</li>
<li>Ability to comment on source code</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Credit card is required</li>
<li>Browser extension is required</li>
<li>Cannot mark up dynamic elements of web pages</li>
</ul>
<h4>Third-Party Integration</h4>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>Chrome</li>
<li>Internet Explorer</li>
<li>Safari</li>
<li>Firefox</li>

<h4>Pricing</h4>
<p>Pricing starts at $19 per month, and a 30-day trial is available. A credit card is required for all plans.</p>
<h3>Our Choice</h3>
<p>Before visual feedback tools, it was difficult to imagine a project manager’s daily workflow without the endless emails and chats between designers and developers. Email was the primary means of communication, and it felt like a big waste of time.</p>
<p>A colleague of ours introduced us to BugHerd, which is an awesome tool for collaborating on web projects, and we started using it. Later, we switched to TrackDuck for a few reasons. First, the service is relatively new and takes advantage of modern web technology. It also offers the same functionality but is significantly more affordable for medium and large teams. In addition, we use Basecamp to manage projects, and the two apps integrate nicely. As a bonus, TrackDuck offers two-way integration, with updates being sent to both systems automatically.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Visual-feedback and bug-tracking services are becoming ever more popular, and integrating one of them into their workflow would simplify the communication process of any web developer. Taking the five that we’ve identified and that we think are the most useful, we’ve laid out the advantages of each in the table below to help you determine which is right for you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To you, <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/05/27/modal-windows-in-modern-web-design/">modal windows</a><sup class="po" id="note-1"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> might be a blessing of additional screen real estate, providing a way to deliver contextual information, notifications and other actions relevant to the current screen. On the other hand, modals might feel like a hack that you’ve been forced to commit in order to cram extra content on the screen. These are the extreme ends of the spectrum, and users are caught in the middle. Depending on how a user browses the Internet, <strong>modal windows can be downright confusing</strong>.</p>
<p>Modals quickly shift visual focus from one part of a website or application to another area of (hopefully related) content. The action is usually not jarring if initiated by the user, but it can be annoying and disorienting if it occurs automatically, as happens with the modal window’s evil cousins, the “nag screen” and the “interstitial.”</p>
<p>However, modals are merely a mild annoyance in the end, right? The user just has to click the “close” button, quickly skim some content or fill out a form to dismiss it.</p>
<p>Well, imagine that you had to navigate the web with a keyboard. Suppose that a modal window appeared on the screen, and you had very little context to know what it is and why it’s obscuring the content you’re trying to browse. Now you’re wondering, “How do I interact with this?” or “How do I get rid of it?” because your keyboard’s focus hasn’t automatically moved to the modal window.</p>
<p>This scenario is more common than it should be. And it’s fairly easy to solve, as long as we make our content accessible to all through sound usability practices.</p>
<p>For an example, I’ve set up a <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/inaccessible.html">demo of an inaccessible modal window</a><sup class="po" id="note-2"><a href="#2">2</a></sup> that appears on page load and that isn’t entirely semantic. First, interact with it using your mouse to see that it actually works. Then, try interacting with it using only your keyboard.</p>
<h3>Better Semantics Lead To Better Usability And Accessibility</h3>
<p>Usability and accessibility are lacking in many modal windows. Whether they’re used to provide additional actions or inputs for interaction with the page, to include more information about a particular section of content, or to provide notifications that can be easily dismissed, modals need to be easy for everyone to use.</p>
<p>To achieve this goal, first we must focus on the semantics of the modal’s markup. This might seem like a no-brainer, but the step is not always followed.</p>
<p>Suppose that a popular gaming website has a full-page modal overlay and has implemented a “close” button with the code below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;div id="modal_overlay"&gt;
  &lt;div id="modal_close" onClick="modalClose()"&gt;
    X
  &lt;/div&gt;
  …
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This <code>div</code> element has no semantic meaning behind it. Sighted visitors will know that this is a “close” button because it looks like one. It has a hover state, so there is some visual indication that it can be interacted with.</p>
<p>But this element has no inherit semantic meaning to people who use a keyboard or screen reader.</p>
<p>There’s no default way to enable users to tab to a <code>div</code> without adding a <code>tabindex</code> attribute to it. However, we would also need to add a <code>:focus</code> state to visually indicate that it is the active element. That still doesn’t give screen readers enough information for users to discern the element’s meaning. An “X” is the only label here. While we can assume that people who use screen readers would know that the letter “X” means “close,” if it was a multiplication sign (using the HTML entity <code>&amp;times;</code>) or a cross mark (<code>&amp;&#035;x274c;</code>), then some screen readers wouldn’t read it at all. We need a better fallback.</p>
<p>We can circumvent all of these issues simply by writing the correct, semantic markup for a button and by adding an ARIA label for screen readers:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;div id="modal_overlay"&gt;
  &lt;button type="button" class="btn-close" id="modal_close" aria-label="close"&gt;
    X
  &lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>By changing the <code>div</code> to a button, we’ve significantly improved the semantics of our “close” button. We’ve addressed the common expectation that the button can be tabbed to with a keyboard and appear focused, and we’ve provided context by adding the ARIA label for screen readers.</p>
<p>That’s just one example of how to make the markup of our modals more semantic, but we can do a lot more to create a useful and accessible experience.</p>
<h3>Making Modals More Usable And Accessible</h3>
<p>Semantic markup goes a long way to building a fully usable and accessible modal window, but still more CSS and JavaScript can take the experience to the next level.</p>
<h4>Including Focus States</h4>
<p>Provide a focus state! This obviously isn’t exclusive to modal windows; many elements lack a proper focus state in some form or another beyond the browser’s basic default one (which may or may not have been cleared by your CSS reset). At the very least, pair the focus state with the hover state you’ve already designed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.btn:hover, .btn:focus {
  background: #f00;
}
</code></pre>
<p>However, because focusing and hovering are different types of interaction, giving the focus state its own style makes sense.</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.btn:hover {
  background: #f00;
}

:focus {
  box-shadow: 0 0 3px rgba(0,0,0,.75);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Really, any item that can be focused should have a focus state. Keep that in mind if you’re extending the browser’s default dotted outline.</p>
<h4>Saving Last Active Element</h4>
<p>When a modal window loads, the element that the user last interacted with should be saved. That way, when the modal window closes and the user returns to where they were, the focus on that element will have been maintained. Think of it like a bookmark. Without it, when the user closes the modal, they would be sent back to the beginning of the document, left to find their place. Add the following to your modal’s opening and closing functions to save and reenable the user’s focus.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var lastFocus;

function modalShow () {
  lastFocus = document.activeElement;
}

function modalClose () {
  lastFocus.focus(); // place focus on the saved element
}
</code></pre>
<h4>Shifting Focus</h4>
<p>When the modal loads, focus should shift from the last active element either to the modal window itself or to the first interactive element in the modal, such as an input element. This will make the modal more usable because sighted visitors won’t have to reach for their mouse to click on the first element, and keyboard users won’t have to tab through a bunch of DOM elements to get there.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var modal = document.getElementById('your-modal-id-here');

function modalShow () {
   modal.setAttribute('tabindex', '0');
   modal.focus();
}
</code></pre>
<h4>Going Full Screen</h4>
<p>If your modal takes over the full screen, then obscure the contents of the main document for both sighted users and screen reader users. Without this happening, a keyboard user could easily tab their way outside of the modal without realizing it, which could lead to them interacting with the main document before completing whatever the modal window is asking them to do.</p>
<p>Use the following JavaScript to confine the user’s focus to the modal window until it is dismissed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function focusRestrict ( event ) {
  document.addEventListener('focus', function( event ) {
    if ( modalOpen &amp;&amp; !modal.contains( event.target ) ) {
      event.stopPropagation();
      modal.focus();
    }
  }, true);
}
</code></pre>
<p>While we want to prevent users from tabbing through the rest of the document while a modal is open, we don’t want to prevent them from accessing the browser’s chrome (after all, sighted users wouldn’t expect to be stuck in the browser’s tab while a modal window is open). The JavaScript above prevents tabbing to the document’s content outside of the modal window, instead bringing the user to the top of the modal.</p>
<p>If we also put the modal at the top of the DOM tree, as the first child of <code>body</code>, then hitting <kbd>Shift + Tab</kbd> would take the user out of the modal and into the browser’s chrome. If you’re not able to change the modal’s location in the DOM tree, then use the following JavaScript instead:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var m = document.getElementById('modal_window'),
    p = document.getElementById('page');

// Remember that &lt;div id="page"&gt; surrounds the whole document,
// so aria-hidden="true" can be applied to it when the modal opens.

function swap () {
  p.parentNode.insertBefore(m, p);
}

swap();
</code></pre>
<p>If you can’t move the modal in the DOM tree or reposition it with JavaScript, you still have other options for confining focus to the modal. You could keep track of the first and last focusable elements in the modal window. When the user reaches the last one and hits <kbd>Tab</kbd>, you could shift focus back to the top of the modal. (And you would do the opposite for <kbd>Shift + Tab</kbd>.)</p>
<p>A second option would be to create a list of all focusable nodes in the modal window and, upon the modal firing, allow for tabbing only through those nodes.</p>
<p>A third option would be to find all focusable nodes outside of the modal and set <code>tabindex="-1"</code> on them.</p>
<p>The problem with these first and second options is that they render the browser’s chrome inaccessible. If you must take this route, then adding a well-marked “close” button to the modal and supporting the <kbd>Escape</kbd> key are critical; without them, you will effectively trap keyboard users on the website.</p>
<p>The third option allows for tabbing within the modal and the browser’s chrome, but it comes with the performance cost of listing all focusable elements on the page and negating their ability to be focused. The cost might not be much on a small page, but on a page with many links and form elements, it can become quite a chore. Not to mention, when the modal closes, you would need to return all elements to their previous state.</p>
<p>Clearly, we have a lot to consider to enable users to effectively tab within a modal.</p>
<h4>Dismissing</h4>
<p>Finally, modals should be easy to dismiss. Standard <code>alert()</code> modal dialogs can be closed by hitting the <kbd>Escape</kbd> key, so following suit with our modal would be expected &mdash; and a convenience. If your modal has multiple focusable elements, allowing the user to just hit <kbd>Escape</kbd> is much better than forcing them to tab through content to get to the “close” button.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function modalClose ( e ) {
  if ( !e.keyCode |s| e.keyCode === 27 ) {
    // code to close modal goes here
  }
}

document.addEventListener('keydown', modalClose);
</code></pre>
<p>Moreover, closing a full-screen modal when the overlay is clicked is conventional. The exception is if you don’t want to close the modal until the user has performed an action.</p>
<p>Use the following JavaScript to close the modal when the user clicks on the overlay:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">mOverlay.addEventListener('click', function( e )
  if (e.target == modal.parentNode)
    modalClose( e );
  }
}, false);
</code></pre>
<h3>Additional Accessibility Steps</h3>
<p>Beyond the usability steps covered above, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/">ARIA roles, states and properties</a><sup class="po" id="note-3"><a href="#3">3</a></sup> will add yet more hooks for assistive technologies. For some of these, nothing more is required than adding the corresponding attribute to your markup; for others, additional JavaScript is required to control an element’s state.</p>
<h4>aria-hidden</h4>
<p>Use the <code>aria-hidden</code> attribute. By toggling the value <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>, the element and any of its children will be either hidden or visible to screen readers. However, as with all ARIA attributes, it carries no default style and, thus, will not be hidden from sighted users. To hide it, add the following CSS:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.modal-window[aria-hidden=”true”] {
  display: none;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the selector is pretty specific here. The reason is that we might not want all elements with <code>aria-hidden="true"</code> to be hidden (as with our earlier example of the “X” for the “close” button).</p>
<h4>role=&#8221;dialog&#8221;</h4>
<p>Add <code>role="dialog"</code> to the element that contains the modal’s content. This tells assistive technologies that the content requires the user’s response or confirmation. Again, couple this with the JavaScript that shifts focus from the last active element in the document to the modal or to the first focusable element in the modal.</p>
<p>However, if the modal is more of an error or alert message that requires the user to input something before proceeding, then use <code>role="alertdialog"</code> instead. Again, set the focus on it automatically with JavaScript, and confine focus to the modal until action is taken.</p>
<h4>aria-label</h4>
<p>Use the <code>aria-label</code> or <code>aria-labelledby</code> attribute along with <code>role="dialog"</code>. If your modal window has a heading, you can use the <code>aria-labelledby</code> attribute to point to it by referencing the heading’s ID. If your modal doesn’t have a heading for some reason, then you can at least use the <code>aria-label</code> to provide a concise label about the element that screen readers can parse.</p>
<h3>What About HTML5’s Dialog Element?</h3>
<p>Chrome 37 beta and Firefox Nightly 34.0a1 support the <code>dialog</code> element, which provides extra semantic and accessibility information for modal windows. Once this native <code>dialog</code> element is established, we won’t need to apply <code>role="dialog"</code> to non-dialog elements. For now, even if you’re using a polyfill for the <code>dialog</code> element, also use <code>role="dialog"</code> so that screen readers know how to handle the element.</p>
<p>The exciting thing about this element is not only that it serves the semantic function of a dialog, but that it come with its own methods, which will replace the JavaScript and CSS that we currently need to write.</p>
<p>For instance, to display or dismiss a dialog, we’d write this base of JavaScript:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var modal = document.getElementById('myModal'),
  openModal = document.getElementById('btnOpen'),
  closeModal = document.getElementById('btnClose');

// to show our modal
openModal.addEventListener( 'click', function( e ) {
  modal.show();
  // or
  modal.showModal();
});

// to close our modal
closeModal.addEventListener( 'click', function( e ) {
  modal.close();
});
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>show()</code> method launches the dialog, while still allowing users to interact with other elements on the page. The <code>showModal()</code> method launches the dialog and prevents users from interacting with anything but the modal while it’s open.</p>
<p>The <code>dialog</code> element also has the <code>open</code> property, set to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>, which replaces <code>aria-hidden</code>. And it has its own <code>::backdrop</code> pseudo-element, which enables us to style the modal when it is opened with the <code>showModal()</code> method.</p>
<p>There’s more to learn about the <code>dialog</code> element than what’s mentioned here. It might not be ready for prime time, but once it is, this semantic element will go a long way to helping us develop usable, accessible experiences.</p>
<h3>Where To Go From Here?</h3>
<p>Whether you use a jQuery plugin or a homegrown solution, step back and evaluate your modal’s overall usability and accessibility. As minor as modals are to the web overall, they are common enough that if we all tried to make them friendlier and more accessible, we’d make the web a better place.</p>
<p>I’ve prepared a <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/accessible.html">demo of a modal window</a><sup class="po" id="note-4"><a href="#4">4</a></sup> that implements all of the accessibility features covered in this article.</p>

<p>Fortunately, we can fix this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;How come I can download an app on my phone and instantly know how to use it, yet need training to use our content management system? Shouldn’t our system be intuitive?&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was just one of the comments I heard in a recent stakeholder interview. <strong>People are fed up with inadequate internal systems.</strong> Many of those I interviewed had given up on the official software. Instead, they use tools like Dropbox, Google Docs and Evernote.</p>
<p>The problem seems to exist across the board. I am hearing the same thing from employees across many companies and sectors. I am also hearing it about almost all types of internal systems, from ones for customer relationship management (CRM) to ones for procurement. They are all painful to use.</p>
<p>Frustration will only increase as millennials enter the workforce. These people are digital natives, and <strong>they expect a certain standard of software</strong>. They expect software to adapt to them, not the other way around.</p>
<p>The result of this frustration is that employees are abandoning these systems. People use email instead of a CRM and put documents in Dropbox rather than on the intranet. This leads to systems being out of date and, thus, irrelevant to the organization.</p>
<p>How have things gotten to this state? Why is enterprise software so bad?</p>
<h3 id="onesizedoesnotfitall">One Size Does Not Fit All</h3>
<p>I think technology is often oversold. “A content management system is the solution to content!” “An intranet is the answer to improving efficiency!” “A CRM system will manage the customer relationship!” But that is just not true.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in the eyes of senior management, once a piece of software is purchased, the problem is solved. Job done, move on to the next challenge.</p>
<p>One size rarely fits all. <strong>Organizations rarely work in the same way</strong>, even within the same sector. Even if a law firm purchases an intranet designed for the legal sector, the system won’t necessarily work well out of the box for that firm.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/different-functionalities-opt.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="People work in different ways. The functionality required by the secretary to the CEO will be different from the functionality required by someone in accounting or HR. Yet many enterprise systems do nothing to streamline the experience for different groups." title="People work in different ways. The functionality required by the secretary to the CEO will be different from the functionality required by someone in accounting or HR. Yet many enterprise systems do nothing to streamline the experience for different groups." /><br /><em>People work in different ways. The functionality required by the secretary to the CEO will be different from the functionality required by someone in accounting or HR. Yet many enterprise systems do nothing to streamline the experience for different groups. (Image source: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/opensourceway/4371000486/">opensourceway</a><sup class="po" id="note-1"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>)</em></p>
<p>Many of these systems <em>could</em> be tailored to the needs of individual organizations or employees, but they are not so out of the box. They need to be configured and optimized, which usually does not happen &mdash; or else the wrong system is purchased to begin with.</p>
<p>There must be a better way.</p>
<h3 id="startingwithusersneeds">Starting With Users’ Needs</h3>
<p>The procurement process for these systems too often begins with a list of desired features. This is the wrong starting point. We should approach internal software in the same way that we develop external applications: starting with users’ needs.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you already have a system in place, identify your different user groups. Who will be using each system? Once you know that, shadow them for a while. <strong>Understand how they work.</strong> What do they do each day, and what system do they already use to get their work done?</p>
<p>Look for pain points in that system, and talk to them about where they get frustrated. Identify the information they need to do their job, and be aware of any clutter that gets in the way.</p>
<p>Finally, identify your users’ top tasks. Which tasks do your different user groups do again and again. These need to be super-accessible.</p>
<p>You might think that you now have enough information to buy a system. But just because something has the functionality you need does not mean it is easy to use. Before leaping for expensive software, design the user experience. We can do that with some simple prototyping.</p>
<h3 id="prototypeyourperfectsystem">Prototype Your Perfect System</h3>
<p>Creating a prototype of how your ideal system would work does not need to be time-consuming or particularly expensive. Best of all, it could replace a long-winded and abstract specification of functions.</p>
<p>Using nothing but a bit of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, we can <strong>build a working prototype that can be tested with real users</strong>. Does this prototype match their workflow? Does it give them quick access to key tasks? Does it accommodate the differences between groups? Which parts of the prototype are having the biggest impact on productivity, and which are just nice to have?</p>
<p>We can iterate on the prototype based on user feedback until it offers the optimal experience.</p>
<p>With that vision in place, you can compromise intelligently.</p>
<h3 id="informedcompromise">Informed Compromise</h3>
<p>A working prototype is a good standard by which to measure different software &mdash; much better than a specification.</p>
<p>Could your existing system be set up to mirror the prototype? If it can’t exactly, then which areas would you have to compromise on? Based on your user testing, are these compromises acceptable?</p>
<p>If your existing system cannot replicate the key functionality of the prototype,<strong> look at alternatives</strong>. Talk to other vendors and show them your prototype. Ask whether their system can replicate it, and once again, decide on areas of compromise based on user feedback.</p>
<p>Do you see the difference here? The experience is designed around the user, not around what the software provides. Also, if you cannot find software that meets the needs of your users, consider building a bespoke system.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/do-what-others-do-opt.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="Buying software off the shelf makes no sense if no one will use it or if it provides no business value." title="Buying software off the shelf makes no sense if no one will use it or if it provides no business value." /><br /><em>Buying software off the shelf makes no sense if no one will use it or if it provides no business value. (Image source: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/opensourceway/4504724163/">opensourceway</a><sup class="po" id="note-2"><a href="#2">2</a></sup>)</em></p>
<p>I know what you’re thinking. This makes sense, but senior management won’t go for it. They won’t pay for a prototype or a bespoke system. Well, that depends on how you sell it.</p>
<h3 id="sellingtheneedforusercentricsystems">Selling The Need For A User-Centric System</h3>
<p>Convincing management to spend money on a prototype can be hard. It’s hard enough when a clever salesperson says that their software will solve all of the company’s problems &mdash; harder still if management has already paid for a fancy system. Nevertheless, solid business arguments can be made for this approach.</p>
<p>If your company has a system that is not fit for its purpose, you should be able to prove this. Collect data on how users interact with the system. Combine this with user testing and stakeholder interviews. This should be enough to establish a compelling case &mdash; at least compelling enough to justify some limited prototyping of an alternative approach.</p>
<p>Remember that you are not asking them to <em>replace</em> the system. You just want to prototype a potentially better solution and see whether the current software could be set up to match it. <strong>When managers see a better way, they will usually be open to change.</strong></p>
<p>If the company does not already own a system, then your position is even stronger. Enterprise software is expensive, and so ensuring the right fit is important. Getting it wrong could mean hundreds or thousands of dollars wasted. A prototype will prove more effective than a specification at measuring the suitability of different products. It will also make it easier to compare software.</p>
<p>Of course, management could take the position that employees will just need to get used to what they have. This argument has some merit. Given time, users would adapt to even the most archaic of systems. But at what cost?</p>
<h3 id="thecostoffailure">The Cost Of Failure</h3>
<p>Poor user interfaces require more training and support. Both are a cost borne by the organization, not to mention the frustration it causes. Even more significant is the cost in lost productivity. Organizations are keen to maximize efficiency, and systems that are easy to use go a long way towards this.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some managers seem to care little about internal processes. But they do care about customer satisfaction, which is becoming one of the most popular factors for organizations to measure. <strong>We now live in a world of consumers who are connected</strong> and have a voice through social media. That makes organizations sensitive to negative comments and experiences.</p>
<p>Internal systems weigh heavily on the performance of your employees. And they have a massive impact on the customer experience. These systems ensure timely responses; they help deliver the product; and they facilitate customer relationships. This is why internal systems are becoming the next big competitive advantage.</p>
