		<description><![CDATA[Lou Noble (aka Lou O' Bedlam) defines himself with this simple statement on his site: "I take pictures, save lives, surf, eat pumpkin-related products. No big whup." But for us, he's a big whup. We found it necessary to get to know him more, especially because we selected Lou to join the judge panel for our inaugural <a href="https://www.flickr.com/20under20">20under20 celebration</a>, highlighting 20 talented young photographers on Flickr.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.flickr.net&#038;blog=957851&#038;post=60581&#038;subd=flickrtheblog&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
