In an effort to help them source exactly the right item, <a href="http://www.likethatapps.com">LikeThat Decor</a> is a visual search app that will present consumers with items similar to those featured in photos they upload.</p>
<p>To get started consumers can either select an item of furniture from the app&#8217;s built in gallery, or upload their own picture — either a photo they have taken themselves or an image from the web (most likely Pinterest or Tumblr). The app then analyses the image and presents the user with similar and complementary items — drawn from the app&#8217;s extensive database of millions of products from thousands of top furniture brands. After the consumer has found an item they like, they can click to make a purchase directly from the retailer. </p>
<p>Both the website and iOS app are free of charge and an Android version will be released later this year. Are there any other departments where visual recognition could aid search in a meaningful way?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="310" height="185" src="http://www.springwise.com/img/uploads/2014/09/imagistory-310x185.png" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="imagistory" title="imagistory" /><div class='pp_favorite_link'><a id="go" rel="leanModal" href="#open-add-45914" data-pid="45914" class="go">Add / Remove </a></div><p>Reading or making up bedtime stories every night can be daunting task for parents. We&#8217;ve already seen <a href="http://www.springwise.com/israel-kids-book-mounted-device-plays-readings-absent-relatives/">The Sparkup Magical Book Reader</a> attempt to tackle this problem by playing recordings made by the child’s family members as they turn each page. While a familiar voice is comforting, a new app called <a href="http://www.imagistory.com">Imagistory</a> takes a different approach, encouraging children to verbalize and narrate their own imagination as they flip through the wordless illustrated stories.</p>
<p>By offering illustrated stories without words or context, the iPad-based picture book app is designed to trigger the creativity of its young readers. The hope is that this creative storytelling will not only lead to more personalized bedtime stories, but it will also act as learning tool for children, helping them to become more engaged and to develop their language and literacy skills. The app also offers the functionality to record voices, so stories can be played back and shared with loved ones. </p>
<p>Beyond the bedroom, Imagistory is aiming to be a central hub for creating, listening and sharing, and the platform will feature the best stories submitted every week for all to listen to. The app is available on iOS and can be downloaded for free from the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/imagistory/id562786443?mt=8">App store</a>. Once downloaded, users can browse and purchase books for approximately 2 USD, which will support both the creators and artists.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/vGeB8rext7A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>How else can technology go against the grain and encourage children to be more imaginative, rather the acting as a replacement</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="310" height="185" src="http://www.springwise.com/img/uploads/2014/09/transfercar-310x185.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="transfercar" title="transfercar" /><div class='pp_favorite_link'><a id="go" rel="leanModal" href="#open-add-45906" data-pid="45906" class="go">Add / Remove </a></div><p>While holiday car rentals may offer greater flexibility and freedom over public transport systems, that flexibility usually comes at a steep financial cost. However, when the plan is to travel from one city to another, there’s now a service that shows how  customers and companies could benefit from each other, while reducing costs and polluting less. <a href="http://www.transfercarus.com">transfercar</a> is an online vehicle relocation service that reduces costs for rental companies while offering a free way to travel.</p>
<p>Car rental services are both spending and polluting on a huge scale in order to relocate cars between different locations. Looking to solve that problem with a perk for the consumer, transfercar is a service that offers holidaying drivers a free one-way rental. Users can visit the transfercar website to see which rentals are available and where those rentals need to be relocated to. If the start point and destination match the driver&#8217;s travel plans, then they&#8217;re good to go — provided they have a driving license valid in the United States and are over 18 years old. The company reasons that by offering the cars for free, rental services will still save by reducing their freight costs and the use of expensive trucks for relocation. The promo video can be seen below:</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/heJLoBhNGA4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>After a successful spell in New Zealand, the company launched in the US last month and will initially focus on transfers between LA, San Francisco, San Jose, San Diego and Las Vegas on the West Coast.<br />
Can you think any other ways where costs can be reduced by involving customers?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="310" height="185" src="http://www.springwise.com/img/uploads/2014/09/tailorbrands-310x185.png" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="tailorbrands" title="tailorbrands" /><div class='pp_favorite_link'><a id="go" rel="leanModal" href="#open-add-45873" data-pid="45873" class="go">Add / Remove </a></div><p>Branding is an important part of any business and can often make the difference between a generic service and another that stands out from the crowd. However, small businesses in particular simply can&#8217;t afford to hire expensive designers if they can&#8217;t create their own marketing materials. While platforms like <a href="http://www.springwise.com/on-demand-design-tweaks-usd-15-pop/"class="unbold">Swiftly</a> have already offered quick design tweaks for as low as USD 15 per job, now <a href="https://www.tailorbrands.com/">Tailor</a> is using natural language processing to help business automatically generate stylish and personalized branding that fits their company.</p>
<p>Using the Tailor web app, companies first answer some questions about their organization, such as name, location, business type and brand values. They&#8217;re then asked to pick from a number of visual cues they think match their style. Using natural language processing and image matching, the service generates a selection of custom typographic logos for users to choose from. If they don&#8217;t like any of the options, they can go back and tweak their descriptions to include more relevant keywords. The basic design package consists of a logo, business card and letterhead design, and Tailor customers pay USD 50 to gain access to the raw design files. Alternatively, they can pay a monthly subscription that enables them to make regular tweaks or additions, as well as store their design files on Tailor&#8217;s own cloud service.</p>
<p>While the Tailor designs can end up lacking a certain human creativity &#8212; the computer-generated logos can come out looking somewhat generic &#8212; they are for the most part slick and modern-looking. The service could certainly help small businesses with limited design nous to give an edge to their branding. Are there other ways to cut the cost of design work for smaller businesses?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="310" height="185" src="http://www.springwise.com/img/uploads/2014/09/daqri-310x185.png" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="daqri" title="daqri" /><div class='pp_favorite_link'><a id="go" rel="leanModal" href="#open-add-45902" data-pid="45902" class="go">Add / Remove </a></div><p>While wearable technology has so far been marketed at the consumer, there are many business cases for products that make data more readily available to workers in the field. We&#39;ve previously written about the <a href="http://www.springwise.com/smart-headset-helps-improve-firefighters-performance-safety/"class="unbold">Golden-i Wireless Headset</a>, which provides firefighters with maps and information about oxygen levels in dangerous environments. Now the <a href="http://hardware.daqri.com/smarthelmet">DAQRI Smart Helmet</a> is providing industrial workers with hardhat protection while also using an augmented reality to help them navigate sites. </p>
<p>Since most of those who work around large machinery or on construction sites are required to wear a helmet, AR specialists DAQRI integrated a further protective visor into the workwear, which doubles as a transparent head up display. It&#39;s also equipped with a 360° camera array and sensors that can map the environment and monitor metrics such as temperature and light levels. Using the HUD, relevant data can be overlayed on top of whatever workers are looking at to provide a better understanding while they&#39;re working. </p>
<p>For example, users could look at a machine gauge and instantly get extra information about how the levels being displayed correspond with those elsewhere on site. The data can even be logged digitally for later use or shared with others using the Smart Helmet.</p>
<p>By detecting user gestures and voice commands, tasks can be carried out without the worker stopping what they&#39;re doing. It&#39;s even compatible with new devices such as smartwatches.</p>
<p>Watch the video below to see a demonstration of the Smart Helmet:</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/qIU456jtkmw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The DAQRI Smart Helmet makes use of a technology — augmented reality — and applies it to industrial use to help users make more sense of the environment they&#39;re working in. Are there other ways that consumer technologies can be applied in the workplace?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="310" height="185" src="http://www.springwise.com/img/uploads/2014/09/alfred-310x185.png" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Photo: Vox Efx/Flickr" title="alfred" /><div class='pp_favorite_link'><a id="go" rel="leanModal" href="#open-add-45896" data-pid="45896" class="go">Add / Remove </a></div><p>In sci-fi tropes, robots of the future are created largely to act as bionic servants that carry out the tasks humans don&#39;t want to do. While that vision is quite a way off, we have seen other uses of technology to help busy (or lazy) homeowners to get jobs done. While apps such as <a href="http://www.springwise.com/app-lets-infirm-crowdsource-daily-tasks/"class="unbold">STANDWITH</a> have helped the infirm to leverage their friends and neighbors to take care of their daily chores, <a href="https://www.alfredclub.com/">Alfred</a> is a service that crowdsources local helpers to act as a butler service for laundry, shopping and cleaning tasks.</p>
<p>While disparate apps such as <a href="http://www.springwise.com/service-lets-cold-flu-victims-order-instant-medication-bed/"class="unbold">TaskRabbit</a> and <a href="http://www.springwise.com/service-crowdsources-items-multiple-grocers-deliver-hour/"class="unbold">Instacart</a> offer similar services, they&#39;re typically tailored towards one-off use. For those who know they&#39;ll need regular help putting their life in order, Alfred connects users with a single helper who visits on a regular basis. Customers simply set up the tasks they want help with — whether it&#39;s grocery shopping, laundry, or picking up mail — and their personal Alfred will head to their home to drop off goods and pick up items for servicing. Users can tweak their settings at any time through their account, as well as request special actions such as party preparation and equipment fixing. The service can also be synced with accounts such as FreshDirect and BlueApron, and Alfreds will monitor their fridges to make sure they don&#39;t run out of favorite foods.</p>
<p>Alfred membership is priced at USD 99 a month, with groceries and other billable costs charged separately. The service recently took first prize at <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/10/and-the-winner-of-techcrunch-disrupt-sf-2014-is-alfred/"class="unbold">TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2014</a> and will be available in Boston before arriving in other US cities. Are there other ways to outsource daily activities using this type of crowdsourcing?</p>

</br><br />
While health care reform hasn’t gone into full swing mode yet, your business can lay a firm foundation for 2015 by following these simple tips: </p>
<p><strong>Choose a benefits strategy<br />
</strong><br />
Though penalties may not yet be a reality, now is the time to plan ahead and make benefits decisions for 2015.</p>
<p>As you research, keep in mind that it’s not simply a benefits package you should be after. Since health care costs continue to rise at rates faster than inflation and wages, businesses should look to experts to help build a benefits strategy that will carry their company into the future.</p>
<p><strong>Prepare employees for what’s ahead<br />
</strong><br />
Though your company cannot protect employees from all of the changes coming their way, you can prepare workers by providing them with the right information and resources to make the best decisions possible.</p>
<p>Help your employees make smart choices by clearly communicating benefits options, and explaining how they can access resources to help them make informed health care decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Embrace workplace wellness and prevention<br />
</strong><br />
Wellness programs give employees the opportunity to take advantage of healthier lifestyles, while possibly lowering the long-term benefits costs by encouraging employees not to skimp on regular preventive care.</p>
<p>Though companies have sought wellness programs and preventive care for years, in 2014 they have the option to offer employees attractive incentives to get involved with those programs and kick poor health habits for good.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="310" height="185" src="http://www.springwise.com/img/uploads/2014/09/fingerreader-310x185.png" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="fingerreader" title="fingerreader" /><div class='pp_favorite_link'><a id="go" rel="leanModal" href="#open-add-45878" data-pid="45878" class="go">Add / Remove </a></div><p>One of the problems with Braille is that it&#39;s typically printed in specialist books aside from the copies created for sighted people, meaning that those with sight difficulties can&#39;t borrow their friends&#39; books and need to seek out the bookstores and libraries that cater for them. In the past, we&#39;ve seen projects such as Thailand&#39;s <a href="http://www.springwise.com/book-read-blind-non-blind-time/"class="unbold">Mr. Light and Mr. Dark</a> — which uses special typography to enable the blind and non-blind to read the same book. Now the <a href="http://fluid.media.mit.edu/projects/fingerreader">FingerReader</a> initiative from MIT provides visually impaired readers with a wearable ring that can scan written text and read it out loud.</p>
<p>Created by MIT Media Lab&#39;s Fluid Interfaces Group, the small device features an on-board camera and can be worn around the index finger. As readers trace lines of text with their finger, the camera uses complex algorithms to determine the words and lines on the page and processes them through a text-to-speech engine to recite each word out loud to the reader. If the reader&#39;s finger begins to veer away from the line they&#39;re on, the ring delivers haptic feedback to guide them in the right direction. Similarly, a small vibration lets them know they&#39;ve reached the end of a line. When moving to a new line, the device compares the words it&#39;s already processed to make sure it doesn&#39;t repeat a piece of text.</p>
<p>The team have already created a working prototype of the FingerReader, but as the video below demonstrates, it&#39;s still in the early stages of development:</p>

<p>The researchers hope that they can bring the device to market, and if they&#39;re successful, the device could render Braille books redundant. Could similar technology be used to help those with poor sight to better navigate new devices such as smartphones and tablets?</p>

However, it&#39;s not a luxury that every speaking occasion affords. <a href="http://www.promptsmart.com/">PromptSmart</a> is an iOS app that mimics the standard autocue, using voice recognition to track users&#39; place in the text.</p>
<p>Users can import their documents in either .docx or .txt format from various cloud services including iCloud, Dropbox and Evernote. Scripts can either be full text or in notecard form, and the app enables users to customize the text style from font size to typeface. As they go through their speech, the app highlights their current place in the text so they can always keep track of where they&#39;re up to.</p>
<p>While speaking, users have 3 ways they can control the flow of the text. They can either manually scroll as they&#39;re reading or set a words-per-minute speed to make the app automatically scroll. A third option, however, uses voice recognition to determine exactly where the speaker is in the text. If they go off script, the scrolling simply stops until they begin to read from the autocue again.</p>
<p>Users can edit their speeches in the app, and also record their speeches as they&#39;re reading.</p>
<p>Watch the video below to learn more about the app:</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/oSB7MZ0a73w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>PromptSmart is available on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/promptsmart-smartest-teleprompter/id894811756?ls=1&amp;mt=8"class="unbold">App Store</a> for USD 9.99. Are there other typically expensive standalone systems that could be turned into a fully-functional smartphone app?</p>

Lives could be saved more frequently if responders had access to the right information to allow them to act more quickly. With this in mind, <a href="http://www.safemate-australia.com.au/">Safe Mate</a> is a wristband for swimmers and surfers that stores medical and emergency data in case they need assistance.</p>
<p>In the event of an accident or problem in the water, lifeguards may need to perform emergency maneuvers to attempt to save a life. However, lifeguards can act more quickly if they know the victim has a medical condition which may require particular treatment or restrict the use of others. The Safe Mate band connects to an online account where owners can add important information that could help save their life. Along with their name and an emergency contact, wearers can also add existing conditions, allergies, blood type and medical records, as well as Medicare and insurance numbers. Lifeguards can then use the Safe Mate <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.safemateaustralia.user"class="unbold">Android app</a> to read the data from the wristband as soon as the victim is out of the water. Each Safe Mate wristband uses encryption to ensure any uploaded details are kept secure. They&#8217;re also available in a range of bright colors and will retail at AUD 25.</p>
<p>Much like the <a href="http://www.springwise.com/headband-stop-kids-drowning/"class="unbold">iSwimband</a>, which uses a location-detecting wristband and is directed at the child/parent market, the innovation could be the difference between someone living and dying. Use of the innovation is already being rolled out by <a href="http://www.manlylsc.com.au/"class="unbold">Manly LSC</a>, located in the north Sydney suburb. Are there other ways to use technology on the waterfront to help save more lives?</p>
