<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This is a guest contribution from Charles Crawford.</em></p>
<p>If your business is blogging, productivity is essential. The only way for you to get the results you want is to put out consistent high quality content. While this is often easy in the beginning when the blog is new and exciting, as time goes on this can become more difficult. There are some ways that you can improve your productivity to keep your blog current.</p>
<h2><strong>1. Work at the Right Times</strong></h2>
<p>A common misconception is that people work better first thing in the morning. The problem with this is people are all different. You may not be a morning person at all.  This is why you need to find the time of day that you are most productive and work then, even if it is 3 AM.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Use Technology to Your Advantage</strong></h2>
<p>If you are like many writers, then inspiration will come at the most unexpected times. You may be sitting at a red light or even in the doctor&#8217;s office when a great idea for a blog will come to you. Rather than trying to remember it, which often is unsuccessful, use your smartphone to your advantage. Apps such as Evernote syncs with your computer and other devices. It will allow you to type note, snap pictures for inspiration or even record audio notes. This is a great way to organize yourself and ensure you never forget an idea again.</p>
<h2><strong>3. Create a Schedule</strong></h2>
<p>A common mistake many bloggers who work from home is not creating a schedule for themselves. When you know what you plan to work on within a time frame, you are more likely to get this done. Otherwise you may find yourself wanting to scroll through your social media feeds or even doing household tasks. Make sure you schedule everything you need to get done for the day, both for work and personal tasks to ensure you get everything done.</p>
<h2><strong>4. Change Things Up</strong></h2>
<p>For those who are not productive because they feel like the blog has gotten stale, find a way to change things up. Write a new style of blog. For instance if you have been reviewing products every week, try making a list style blog with great images that matches the theme of the site. Don&#8217;t be afraid to try something new as this is a great way to grow your writing skills and have more fun.</p>
<h2><strong>5. Have Fun</strong></h2>
<p>If you aren&#8217;t having fun with the blog, then it simply won&#8217;t work. Find ways to make the blog fun. This can be with giveaways, Q and A sessions or many other activities. Make a list of different things you would like to do with the blog and if you can&#8217;t think of any new ideas, visit other blogs to get inspiration and ideas.</p>
<h2><strong>6. Work on it Every Day</strong></h2>
<p>Even if you just spend five minutes writing or tweaking, you will find that this will make you more productive. In fact, you may also find that the five minutes turns into half an hour and you have the first draft of your next blog done or have taken care of the back end SEO work you have been putting off since you created the site.</p>
<h2><strong>7. Utilize Social Media</strong></h2>
<p>Social media is a great way to connect with your audience and find out what they are looking for. You will also find this helpful in keeping you motivated to put out the next blog, as you know there are people waiting. Your fans can be a great source of support and help when you are not feeling productive.</p>

]]></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/How-To-Build-A-Successful-Blog.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-32531" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/How-To-Build-A-Successful-Blog.jpg" alt="How To Build A Successful Blog" width="600" height="292" /></a>This is a guest contribution from Gary Dek from <a href="http://www.startablog123.com/">StartABlog123.com</a>.</em></p>
<p>If your blog is dependent on Google search engine rankings like most websites, you should know that one record month of traffic can easily be followed by a record low. Growing your blog’s traffic and revenue requires leveraging traffic and design strategies to build and retain visitors, eventually converting them into loyal readers and followers. Otherwise, you risk the chance of starting from zero after an algorithm update.</p>
<p>Here are some possible reasons your blog is failing to capitalize on its current readership, and what you can do about it.</p>
<h2><strong>The Cornerstones of Building A Following</strong></h2>
<p><em>You are not actively seeking growth</em>. If you update your blog regularly with comprehensive, high-quality content and are not seeing growth in terms of traffic from returning visitors, then you are doing something wrong. Chances are, your traffic is comprised of one-time visitors who forget all about you after they’ve exited your blog.</p>
<p>What can you do to <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2014/06/01/6-things-to-do-with-your-blog-posts-after-youve-hit-publish/">maintain a connection</a>?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Collect emails</strong>. If you don’t collect email addresses from your readers, you can’t get those readers to come back to your blog on a regular basis. You can use these emails to send a message each time you publish a new post. Alternatively, you can send a weekly or bi-weekly newsletter highlighting your best posts within that period. A mailing list can even offer a targeted audience who may be interested in a new product or service you’ve developed, leading to a higher conversion rate than a general blog post. Whatever your reason for collecting emails, doing it will keep your readership updated and constantly interacting with your brand. <strong>Word of caution:</strong> make sure you ask for permission before you add an email to a newsletter or mailing list. Like you, I absolutely hate it when blogs add me as a subscriber when I input my email for another purpose. The last thing you want is to be labeled or even reported as a spammer.</li>
<li><strong>Build a community</strong>. Blogging has always been all about people interacting on a more personal level compared to traditional news outlets. If your blog is not growing, then you may have issues with engagement. Are you getting comments? Are you responding to comments? Do you have a group of people who talk to each other through your blog? Do you ask for user input at the end of each blog post? Is your comment system intuitive and easy to use? Is your content original, personal, and addressing the needs and wants of your readers? These are some of the questions you need to ask yourself when <a href="http://www.jeffbullas.com/2014/08/02/9-tips-on-how-to-build-raving-fans-for-your-blog/">building a community around your blog</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Get on social media</strong>. People spend more time on social networking platforms than other sites. In 2014, Facebook reported that the average user spends 17 minutes on the site every day. If you want to get a reader’s attention, then you need to have a social media presence. Start with one or two platforms – Facebook and Twitter – and build your presence there. Share your posts. Ask your readers for their opinions or experiences. Pose a question. Share other experts’ guides. You don’t even need to stay on your own Facebook page – interact with other blogging authorities in the niche and build relationships. If your contributions are insightful, you may even be invited to guest blog. The <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2013/11/28/11-ways-i-diversified-traffic-sources-for-my-blogs-to-become-less-reliant-upon-google-with-a-surprising-twist/">traffic you build through your social sharing</a> can never be taken away from you by Google’s algorithm.</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Are You Insecure About Your Knowledge or Blogging Skills?</strong></h2>
<p><em>You lack conviction. </em>Some of the most common indications that you don’t believe in yourself or your ability to offer value through your blog content include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://fizzle.co/sparkline/10-fast-ways-to-become-a-better-writer-even-when-youre-burning-the-midnight-oil-and-cant-afford-an-editor-just-yet">You don’t think you’re a writer</a> because you didn’t major in journalism or creative writing.</li>
<li>You question your authority to write about a certain topic.</li>
<li>You think, “Who am I to express my opinion strongly to the public?”</li>
<li>You’re afraid to let your personality shine in your writing.</li>
<li>You’re a perfectionist and afraid to post anything but a 10,000 word “masterpiece” that covers every angle, argument, or consideration.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you consistently feel self-doubt, then you need to take a step back and remember why you started blogging in the first place. The <a href="http://www.startablog123.com/">barriers to entry when starting a blog are so low</a> that you could have written about anything, but you chose this niche for a reason.</p>
<p>Either you had first-hand experience and knowledge in the industry and you believed you could make a difference or you were passionate about learning something new and wanted to document your research and journey.</p>
<p>The former is common in the SEO industry, where online marketers who worked for agencies or themselves building and selling sites decide they want to finally share all their SEO knowledge with the masses. The latter is common in the personal finance niche, where individuals document their own troubles managing money and share their journey to financial independence.</p>
<p>If you do not have that confidence and passion anymore, you can do all the research you want and spew thousand-word posts, but your writing will not resonate with your audience.</p>
<p><strong>Blogging Isn’t Just About Writing.</strong> Remember, you don’t have to be a poet to create a useful article. As the respected author E.B. White said, “<em>Writing is an act of faith, not a trick of grammar.</em>” You need to find that confidence and believe that you have something to offer your readers. Don’t let your lack of training as a writer bring you down. All things can be learned, but passion can’t be faked.</p>
<p>This lack of self-belief can also lead to the next problem.</p>
<p><em>Your blog is bland</em>. Tepid. Has no personality. There are millions of blogs out there and the number of online visitors is finite. You need to have something unique to attract readers and <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2009/02/24/next-level-blogging/">grow your audience</a>. Since more than one person is ever writing about the same topic, you must add your own unique touch or contribution.</p>
<p>Some ways to do this:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Inject your real-life personality in your writing</strong>. If you’re outspoken and unabashed, then write that way. If you aren’t, force yourself to be and share all the things you’ve always wanted to say but didn’t.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t shy away from controversy</strong>. Even though you may not have a confrontational personality, discussing controversial issues can help your blog get attention. People like controversy, and they like discussing it. Whether they agree with you or not, it doesn’t matter. What counts is that you get them reading, sharing, and commenting. However, always think before you “speak” and don’t make a fool of yourself.</li>
<li><strong>Talk to your readers as if they were right in front of you</strong>. Much like letting your personality shine through your writing, you also need to remember that your readers are real people and not just numbers in your analytics report. Write as if you were having a conversation with one of them. Create something that you yourself will want to read and share.</li>
<li><strong>It’s okay to be weird</strong>. Let’s be honest – we’re all weird. I’m OCD about cleanliness and organization. Everything on my desk is parallel or perpendicular to each other. Everything on my laptop is titled a certain way and saved for optimal convenience and efficiency, including my music and movies. When setting my thermostat or the volume on the TV, I prefer even numbers or ones ending in 5. Those of you who share my “weirdness” may feel an instant connection with me because we share the same “problems” ;). Weird is definitely more eye-catching than bland.</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Treat Your Blog Like A Business</strong></h2>
<p><em>Everything you offer is free</em>. There is nothing wrong with giving away free content, products, or services. But if you want to grow a blog and make money online, you need to train your readers not to expect everything for free. Sometimes the most valuable information or tools require an investment of your time and money to develop, and you will need to take that into consideration.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, you should understand that “paying” doesn’t always involve money. Many readers have an aversion to shelling out money for content, especially if you are not a big name yet or have given everything for free up till now. Fortunately, you can achieve growth in other ways.</p>
<p>One way is to show only a snippet of a long-form resource. Make sure that the preview is interesting enough to make readers want to read the entire resource. Here comes the caveat – in order for the reader to see the whole article, you ask them to tweet or share the URL on Facebook. Not only do you provide something of value, but you also get something in return: more exposure. Similarly, you can require an email address for your mailing list.</p>
<p>This strategy isn’t innovative and new for 2014, but it does work and can provide a way to constantly keep in touch with your readership, as discussed earlier in this post.</p>
<p><em>You’re not taking things seriously</em>. You most probably started blogging as a hobby. Then one day, you installed AdSense on your blog and started making a couple dollars a day. Several months went by and that part-time income started growing to an amount that made you realize the potential of your blog.</p>
<p>The problem is that some bloggers who want to succeed still don’t take blogging all that seriously. They think that it’s just writing and publishing whenever they want. And when they analyze their websites, they are subjective and passive instead of being honest and critical with themselves.</p>
<p>Here are some things you can do to take your blog to the next level by taking it more seriously.</p>
<p><strong>Be consistent</strong>. Consistency is vital to your blog’s success. You should maintain an <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2009/04/17/editorial-calendar/">editorial calendar</a> or simply choose to post Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Consistency means being in it for the long haul. Don’t rest on your accomplishments for the past month – set new goals and keep working.</p>
<p><strong>Manage your time well</strong>. If you want blogging to be a source of income, then you need to <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2014/07/30/problogger-in-perth-10-things-darren-wishes-he-knew-about-blogging/">run your blog like a business</a>. That means you need to learn to manage your time and have a good work-life balance. Set work hours, and set aside time to spend with your friends and family. When you know you have all day to accomplish a task, you will likely procrastinate. Alternatively, when I’m feeling burned out, I like to go on vacation or visit a nice part of town. Having fun or observing other successful people motivates me to get there too.</p>
<h2><strong>Always Hold Yourself Accountable</strong></h2>
<p>I feel this is where a lot of people fail, whether they are bloggers, entrepreneurs, or employees. Do you want to <em>appear to be</em> or <em>feel</em> successful, or do you want your dreams to be a reality? You can blame your blog’s stalled growth on Google, Facebook, competing bloggers, or your hosting company, but ultimately, you are the boss.</p>
<p>You are the master of your own fate, and that is one of the best feelings in the world. Except for extenuating circumstances, your blog’s success begins and ends with you. This can either empower and motivate you or cripple you.</p>
<p>As a final thought, I leave you with one of my favorite quotes by Mark Twight:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Modern man is conditioned to expect instant gratification, but any success or triumph realized quickly, with only marginal effort, is necessarily shallow. Meaningful achievement takes time, hard work, persistence, patience, proper intent and self-awareness. The path to success is punctuated by failure, consolidation, and renewed effort.”</em></p></blockquote>

What an amazing two days!</p>
<p>This was our second year of holding the event on the Gold Coast in Queensland Australia but it was the first time we&#8217;d had over 500 attendees all in the one room.</p>
<p>When I came up with the idea for the first PBEVENT back in 2010 I envisaged a small group of bloggers gathering around a board table in a meeting room somewhere but had no idea of what would happen to the event &#8211; or the Aussie blogosphere in the following five years.</p>
<p>Both have exploded &#8211; in a good way!</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="P8290107.jpg" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/P8290107.jpg" alt="P8290107" width="600" height="506" border="0" /></p>
<p>This year&#8217;s event took a good 11 months to plan for &#8211; with the help of an amazing team. We had 550 attendees, over 30 speakers (four internationals and the rest from around Australia), three new niche networking events, three new &#8216;accelerator&#8217; workshops, a special partner event with <a href="http://aweber.com/?utm_source=problogger-event&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=sponsor&amp;utm_content=problogger-event-14">Aweber</a>, and one crazy networking party (with a nautical theme).</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="NewImage.png" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/NewImage4.png" alt="NewImage" width="600" height="600" border="0" /><br />
<em>Image by <a href="http://instagram.com/carlyfindlay">CarlyFindlay</a></em></p>
<p>Our international speakers this year were amazing. <a href="http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/">Pat Flynn</a>, <a href="http://moz.com/rand/">Rand Fishkin</a>, <a href="http://www.everywhereist.com/about/">Geraldine DeRuiter</a> and <a href="http://www.chrisducker.com/">Chris Ducker</a> all made the big trip down under and all completely brought it to their sessions &#8211; delivering high quality presentations and really practical advice.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="NewImage.png" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/NewImage5.png" alt="NewImage" width="600" height="600" border="0" /><br />

<p>Our Aussie speakers also blew our socks off with their storytelling, advice and generosity.</p>

<p>The Australian blogosphere has continue to grow and mature in the last 12 months and the spirit in the room over our two days of training was incredible. This year almost two thirds of attendees were with us for their first time, most of whom were in their first year of blogging. Something is happening in Australia!</p>

<h3>Surprise and Delights</h3>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="NewImage.png" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/NewImage2.png" alt="NewImage" width="600" height="600" border="0" /></p>

<p>This year we did a few of surprise and delight moments through the conference. <a href="http://www.virginaustralia.com/">Virgin Australia</a> gave three attendees a total of 800,000 velocity points, <a href="http://www.olympus.com.au/">Olympus Australia</a> gave away their amazing OMD camera, and <a href="http://probloggerevents.com/tourism-and-events-queensland/">Tourism and Events Queensland</a> gave one attendee the cost of getting to and attending our conference back to them. Oh &#8211; and then there was the free massages and coffee from <a href="http://www.bupa.com.au/">Bupa</a> and the networking events from <a href="http://www.lorealparis.com.au/">L&#8217;Oreal</a> (where I got made up with smokey eyes &#8211; see below), <a href="http://www.anniesloanunfolded.com/">Annie Sloan</a> and <a href="http://www.pureharvest.com.au/">Pure Harvest</a>.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="NewImage.png" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/NewImage.png" alt="NewImage" width="600" height="600" border="0" /><br />
<em>Image by <a href="https://twitter.com/brandmeetsblog">BrandMeetsBlog</a></em></p>
<p>We also surprised those attendees who have been to all five PBEVENTS with free tickets to next year&#8217;s event, a couple of attendees with a trip to Melbourne to spend the day with the ProBlogger team to help take their blog to the next level, and another with a date night for her and her husband at a hotel in Perth along with free tickets to next years PBEVENT in Perth and next year&#8217;s main event.</p>
<p>We also had opportunity spend time with <a href="http://www.reach.org.au/">The Reach Foundation</a> and hear from one of their wonderful young crew members to tell us about the work they do with thousands of Aussie young people.</p>
<p>I also had a few moments of surprise &#8211; one being on the last night when my team all appeared at drinks with Darren Rowse Tattoos!</p>

<h3>Ordinary People Doing Extraordinary Things</h3>
<p>PBEVENT is fast becoming the highlight of my year each year &#8211; I love seeing the progression in our attendees from one year to another. Numerous bloggers who I met back in 2010-11 as brand new bloggers are now full time bloggers and launching amazing projects.</p>
<p>The theme of my opening keynote this year is that blogging is something that enables normal, ordinary people to do extraordinary things. In the Aussie blogosphere (as it is around the world) this is something I&#8217;ve seen hundreds of times.</p>
<p>In the last 12 months alone we&#8217;ve seen bloggers launching books and eBooks:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="Screen Shot 2014-09-09 at 3.45.12 pm.png" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-09-at-3.45.12-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014 09 09 at 3 45 12 pm" width="600" height="300" border="0" /></p>
<p>Launching businesses and training courses:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Screen Shot 2014-09-09 at 3.45.18 pm.png" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-09-at-3.45.18-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014 09 09 at 3 45 18 pm" width="600" height="309" border="0" /></p>
<p>Experimenting with Kickstarter and Pozible campaigns:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Screen Shot 2014-09-09 at 3.45.27 pm.png" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-09-at-3.45.27-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014 09 09 at 3 45 27 pm" width="600" height="331" border="0" /></p>
<p>Developing Apps and running events:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Screen Shot 2014-09-09 at 3.45.34 pm.png" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-09-at-3.45.34-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014 09 09 at 3 45 34 pm" width="600" height="334" border="0" /></p>
<p>And that&#8217;s just scratching the surface.</p>
<h3>Bigger than One Direction and Football</h3>
<p>Our attendees certainly like to use social media!</p>
<p>PBEVENT this year knocked AFL football, Rugby and the birthday of one of the OneDirection group off the number-one trending perch on Twitter for two and a half days nationally in Australia.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="NewImage.png" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/NewImage8.png" alt="NewImage" width="600" height="600" border="0" /><br />
<em>Image by <a href="http://instagram.com/ken_burgin">Ken_burgin</a></em></p>
<p>Over the two days of the event the #PBEVENT hashtag had around 15,000 tweets with over 47,000,000 impressions (over the month around the event this is closer to 80,000,000 impressions), over <a href="http://websta.me/tag/pbevent/?vm=grid&amp;npk=0">3000 instagrams</a> and since the event we&#8217;ve seen more blog posts written about the event than we can keep up with.</p>
<p>Following are just some of the blog posts we&#8217;ve found that give you a speaker/attendee perspective on what it&#8217;s like to attend a PBEVENT.</p>
<p>But before I get to those posts &#8211; I want to say another huge thank you to the team who helped run this year&#8217;s event. To Jasmin, Nicole and Laney who returned this year to form our core team. To those around them who put in many hours including Caroline, Liz, Shayne, Stacey, Yvonne, Cheryl, Jade, Brooke, Grove, Nathalie, Martine, Louisa Claire and to the many others who pitched in and lent a hand throughout the event.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s just some of the team behind this year&#8217;s event pictured int he Olympus booth at our nautical networking party (yes, that&#8217;s me as Jack Sparrow). <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.848617295149466.1073741923.178709468806922&amp;type=1">See more shots from this Photo Booth here</a>.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="NewImage.png" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/NewImage1.png" alt="NewImage" width="600" height="450" border="0" /></p>
<p>All our speakers and panelists &#8211; thanks so much for your time and generosity.</p>
<p>Also a huge thanks to our sponsors (all mentioned above) who helped to keep our event as what I hear over and over again is one of the most affordable and value-packed events in Australia.</p>
<p>Lastly to our attendees this year and to the wider Australian Blogosphere &#8211; your support and encouragement drive us on to keep improving PBEVENT. As I said in closing this year&#8217;s event we&#8217;re already planning the 2015 events (yes there will be more than one).</p>
<p>We&#8217;re hoping to run a full day event early in 2015 in Perth and another multi day event at a similar time next year (location to be announced) as well as some smaller meet up events in other capital cities early in the year.</p>

<h3>What Our Attendees Thought About this Year&#8217;s Event</h3>
<p>As promised above &#8211; here are just some of the blog posts we&#8217;ve found about this year&#8217;s event from attendees and speakers. Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/jadecraven">Jade Craven</a> for helping me get this list together! Enjoy!</p>

<p><em>This is a guest contribution from SEO expert <a href="http://seocontent.ca" target="_blank">Zach Radford.</a></em></p>
<p>Today, you don&#8217;t gain blog traffic by paying for backlinks or by swapping them like the old days. Instead, you need to focus on creating <strong>quality content that is beneficial to your visitors</strong>.</p>
<p>We know that. But how do you do it? And do it consistently?</p>
<p>The content should solve main problems faced by your reader. It should be <strong>actionable, specific and relevant to the audience</strong>. If you do this, your audience will come to trust your site, and visit it regularly looking for new content. They will also engage with you, which helps you to improve your blog.</p>
<p>To that end, here are five new ways of looking at increasing your blog traffic.</p>
<h2>Create quality content and mention other bloggers</h2>
<p>Your blog is the main avenue for communication with your audience. While your main purpose for the blog may be to promote your business, yourself, or some other product or service, you need to focus on providing quality content to the reader. Just focus on providing information that readers will find interesting to read, without trying to be overly strategic about it. Look for trending topics in different areas and create amazing content on those topics. Your audience will not only keep coming back for more if they find your posts interesting, they will also share your posts with their friends. You also need to mention other bloggers that you follow in your posts. You can quote them if you feel the information is interesting to the reader or just mention their names in the post. This will create good relationships with the bloggers and they might return the favour. Lifting each other up has the added benefit of leading to increased traffic.</p>
<h2>Share your blogs on social networks</h2>
<p>This is a no-brainer, but cannot be ignored. Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and Linkedin are where your readers are. Give them your posts. After creating your post, you can share a link of the post through Facebook or Twitter and then ask your friends or followers to comment. This will expose your blogs to thousands of social media users and eventually lead to increase in blog traffic.</p>
<h2>Syndicate your posts</h2>
<p>Syndicating your blog posts will expose them to more readers. You can use RSS feed or syndicate the blog to applicable high-traffic sites. RSS feeds allow your audience to keep track of your blogs without having to bookmark it. The readers only need to open their RSS reader and all your posts will be displayed there. Syndicating your blog to high traffic sites will also popularize it. This will also give your post more credibility, which could lead to high traffic.</p>
<h2>Involve your readers</h2>
<p>After posting to your blog, you need to ask your readers to leave a comment after reading the blog. Research shows that people will do (mostly) what you ask of them, and will comment where they might not have before. Read the comments that are left and try to reply all of them. Readers feel more valued if they are treated well and respected by the bloggers they engage with. They will keep on visiting your site to look for more content and to engage you as well. This will also build trust with your readers.</p>
<h2>Use Pinterest Individual or Group Board</h2>
<p>Pinterest allows bloggers to post on individual board and collaborate by posting on contributor boards. The main benefit of pinning your blog on contributor boards is that your blog is exposed to other contributors. Those contributors also have followers who will also see your post, leading to increased traffic.</p>
<h3>The bottom line</h3>
<p>Your blog will attract more readers if it is <strong>of good quality</strong>. Above all, this has to be the main aim. Therefore, it is important that you focus on quality more than selling your products or promoting your business through the blog. You also need to network with other bloggers and create good relationships with them. This will help you gain new ideas of increasing traffic to your blog.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Regular readers of ProBlogger would know that over the last 18 months, I&#8217;ve put a lot of <a title="Facebook: The Lowdown on Advertising, and What We’ve Found Works Really Well" href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2014/08/08/lowdown-on-advertising/">effort into Facebook</a> &#8211; particularly by building up the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/digitalps">Digital Photography School Facebook page</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve worked hard in that time to grow both the reach and influence of the page and while there have been ups and downs along the way, it has paid off in a fairly major way &#8211; with Facebook becoming the second-biggest referrer of traffic to <a href="http://digital-photography-school.com/">Digital Photography School</a> on any given day.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/digitalps"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="dps-facebook-page.png" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/dps-facebook-page.png" alt="Dps facebook page" width="600" height="321" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>In the last year and a half I&#8217;ve developed a publishing rhythm on the dPS Facebook page that works really well. I publish five posts every day &#8211; two posts link to new tutorials on the dPS blog, while the other three link to posts from the archives (all from at least a year ago). Occasionally I throw in a discussion-related post but almost every post links back to quality tutorials on dPS.</p>
<p>Facebook seems to like what we do, as they seem to reward links to useful content. B<strong>ut more importantly to me,</strong> our readers seem to like what we&#8217;ve built with the page (which in turn helps Facebook like it too) and I&#8217;m hesitant to change up the rhythm too much.</p>
<p>I have experimented with more posts in a day from time to time, but five seems to be about right. When I&#8217;ve gone with more I get reader complaints that we&#8217;re posting too much.</p>
<h3>Two Other Strategies Bloggers Are Using to Good Effect</h3>
<p>At the recent ProBlogger Conference here in Australia, I had conversations with a number of Aussie bloggers who were also doing very well with Facebook and was interested to hear that my approach is not the only way to grow an effective Facebook strategy.</p>
<p>In fact I heard 4-5 bloggers say that they&#8217;d noticed that their page did best when they did a couple of things different to what we do:</p>
<ol>
<li>they post more frequently &#8211; while we post five times a day, some of the other bloggers I&#8217;ve been talking to publish up to 10 times a day (spread evenly through a 24-hour period) with little pushback from readers.</li>
<li>they link out to other sites regularly &#8211; while at dPS we only really publish links to our own site, these other bloggers see increased reach and engagement with mixing up where they link to other people&#8217;s sites.</li>
</ol>
<p>While I&#8217;m wanting to mess with the approach I currently have on the dPS Facebook page, I&#8217;ve been wondering since our conference how I could experiment with these approaches.</p>
<h3>Why Not Start a Second Facebook Page?</h3>
<p>Just over a week ago I was pondering the issue and wishing I had another site to experiment with Facebook on when it struck me &#8211; why don&#8217;t I just start a second Facebook page that relates to my site?</p>
<p>Most bloggers have a Facebook page dedicated to their blog &#8211; but what is to stop us from having more than one? Facebook don&#8217;t seem to have a problem with a user owning more than one page &#8211; so I began to wonder if there might be a benefit from having a second one to experiment with and potentially support my blog in a different way.</p>
<p>On the spur of the moment I decided to start one and quickly did so. I didn&#8217;t put a heap of thought into what to call it and impulsively decided to call it <a href="https://www.facebook.com/doyoulikephotos">Do You Like Photography?</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/doyoulikephotos"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="do-you-like-photography-facebook.png" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/do-you-like-photography-facebook.png" alt="Do you like photography facebook" width="600" height="243" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The idea was to brand it as different to &#8216;Digital Photography School&#8217; but to be up front about the connection to the site.</p>
<p>I quickly set it up and began to post to it. This is what I&#8217;ve focused upon doing:</p>
<ul>
<li>posing 6 posts per day &#8211; while only up by one on my regular page and not really much higher a frequency, I decided not to go with too many yet as we&#8217;ve been recovering from our conference and on a family holiday. I do plan to increase it gradually but will probably cap it at nine a day and watch how the frequency impacts the page&#8217;s effectiveness.</li>
<li>to this point all posts are &#8216;link&#8217; posts that link five times per day to other people&#8217;s photography tips/tutorials. The 6th post a day links to an old dPS post. I want this page to be tied to dPS but to be more of a place to curate content from other sites. This has the benefit of being useful to followers but also build relationships with other sites.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>in many ways this second page is similar to what we&#8217;ve been doing on our <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/dpschool/">dPS Pinterest page</a> for a year now (it&#8217;s largely just us highlighting great content that we find on the web with a few pins to our own stuff too).</em></p>
<p>I linked twice to the new page from our main dPS page just to let our regular readers know it existed. I shared it with them saying that the page is for those who want more photography tips and tutorials in their feed that come from beyond just dPS. The response from these two shares was fantastic &#8211; I had many readers thank me for creating the page.</p>
<p>The new page has grown faster than I anticipated. It took just six days to hit 50,000 followers! Things have slowed down a little since then but we&#8217;re well on the way to 60,000. Obviously many of the initial likes came from our main dPS page but since those initial shares I&#8217;ve started to see other pages sharing our finds and there&#8217;s been some nice organic growth too.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have any real firm goals for the page at this point but really see it as a great place to:</p>
<ul>
<li>experiment with a different strategies on Facebook</li>
<li>growing relationships with other bloggers in our niche by sending them traffic</li>
<li>expanding our own social reach/influence which will in turn send us some more traffic too</li>
<li>sharing different types of posts to see what I can learn that might inform our own content strategy down the track</li>
</ul>
<p>The only cost of the experiment is the time it takes to update the page. At this point it&#8217;s taking about 15 minutes each night to schedule the next day&#8217;s posts. I&#8217;ve also seen some nice engagement and sentiment coming from followers and it has already sent some nice little spikes in traffic to my blog so for now &#8211; it&#8217;s an experiment worth continuing with.</p>
<h3>Do You Have a Second Facebook Page?</h3>
<p>I&#8217;d love to hear whether others have experimented with different Facebook pages? I&#8217;d expect that it won&#8217;t suit everyone but do wonder if there might be some benefits for some to do it &#8211; particularly for those with bigger followings who might have lost traction with Facebook in the last year? Maybe having a second page with a very different strategy might unlock some learnings for you!</p>

<p><em>This is a guest contribution from Luke Guy.</em></p>
<p>I support building your email list more than any other thing. It’s the building block to any platform-building. You should be collecting emails <em>before you even build the blog or write the book</em>. I Wish I did it this way to begin with.</p>
<p><b>Why?</b></p>
<p>Collecting emails has got to be the<b> fastest, easiest, cheapest</b> way to build a community. You can approach someone and more likely get their email than a <b>“like”</b> on Facebook. Email is about discovery. Facebook is about liking what we already like.</p>
<p><b>You know this though.</b> You know that email is the way to build your online presence. You know the benefits and have heard it plenty of times. But like anything though, everything has it challenges.</p>
<h1>Challenges With Email</h1>
<p><b>1. Collecting the Emails</b></p>
<p><b>2. Providing Content For Those Emails</b></p>
<p><b>3. Keeping Your Email Open Rates High</b></p>
<p><b>4. Keeping Unsubscribe Rates Low</b></p>
<p>You’ve probably read the “<a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2014/03/14/8-reasons-why-your-email-open-rate-is-nosediving/">8 Reasons Why Your Email Open Rate is Nosediving</a>” that I wrote for Problogger a while back. These points listed within that post will give you insight on how to format those emails. It was mostly about format, and how Google sees your email campaign.</p>
<p>Either as spammy or as friend, you’re one or the other with Google.</p>
<p>Today isn’t about the technical side of things though, it’s about your performance in content. You can do all the things mentioned in the previous post, as formatting goes, and still miss potential readers and customers because the content was horrible.</p>
<h1>How To Crush Email Challenges</h1>
<p>Okay, so you have these challenges looking at you like a ban of ugly monsters and not sure how to tackle them. You’ve tried everything and no one wants to join your email list, your open rates are low, and the few that have joined are unsubscribing just weeks after joining.</p>
<p>I want to solve this for you. If you focus on this one thing, it will make your email list explode, <b>Connecting with Quality Information.</b></p>
<h1>Here’s four ways to Make This Happen:</h1>
<h3><b>1. Making your list a secret club</b></h3>
<p>Let’s think about this for a second. What’s in it for them when they join your list? If you think they’re joining <b>so you can punch them every week with a pitch</b>, you’re wrong.</p>
<p>You’ve got to offer benefits. Make them feel part of a <b>secret club</b>. People love feeling like they’re “in”, you know? To feel connected with someone they look up to is one reason why they join.</p>
<p><b>Here are some other things you could be offering to your list:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Offer <b>instant contact</b> when they join your list</li>
<li>Give your list <b>exclusive opportunities</b> like when your product launches</li>
<li>Let your list be the<b> “beta testers” </b>with any new software, program, app. Get their feedback and make them feel like they created the product with you.</li>
<li>Skype with them individually. <b>Pick out five a month</b> and just email with them back and forth. Do it as a surprise though. This makes things exciting.</li>
<li><b>Offer free courses on the email list</b>, get their feedback, improve the course based on that feedback, and then sell it on your site. They feel special because they got it free, and they just made it huge because of the amazing feedback. Then on top of that, you’re making money on a product that was formed by a community. <b>Isn’t that cool?</b></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>2. Only send emails that are useful</b></h3>
<p>Make sure every time you send out an email it gives them a feeling. A good feeling. A feeling of hope, inspiration, and success. An email, that when they’re done, makes them feel like <b>they’ve walked away with something valuable.</b> Don’t just send an email that reminds them you’re still alive. It should never be like that. Send an email that is worth a lot and <b>makes that reader a raving fan.</b> If that means one email instead of two a week, then let it be. <a href="http://lukeguy.com/how-to-find-content-for-you-to-write-about/"><b>How To Find CONTENT For You To Write About</b></a> is a great post if you&#8217;re stuck on how to create more valuable content.</p>
<h3><b>3. Offer something of value to push them over (like a contest).</b></h3>
<p>You remember all those benefits I mentioned in the first section? List it on the signup page. Make it feel like a free membership with benefits, because if there is no benefits, you’re not getting many subscribers. Advertise the benefits on that page creatively.</p>
<p>But on top of that offer something that is enticing to new people who haven’t experienced those other things yet. Offer a product, service, ebook etc, that you know is something they would crave. Something that would make them sign up today! Make sure it’s relative to what you do. <b>Offering an iPad is not a good idea by the way.</b></p>
<p>Then start a contest and offer this prize. Your list will grow quickly, but understand it takes a lot of energy and can’t be done too often. You’ll lose the buzz.</p>
<p><span style="color: #222222;">I&#8217;m offering the Kingsumo contest plugin ($594) <a href="I'm%20offering the Kingsumo contest plugin ($594) here free in my contest" target="_blank">here free in my contest</a>. You have to be in it to win it!</span></p>
<h3><b>4. Don’t be like other bloggers. Be available </b></h3>
<p>Make your email list about <b>connectivity.</b> Offer your list more availability than anywhere else. I don’t care if you have 100k readers on your list, answer every email in a timely manner. This is a major problem in the blogging world. You can email most bloggers, and <b>you’re lucky to get a reply.</b> The ones making the money though, many of those will.</p>
<p><b>Is there a connection?</b> Yes.</p>
<p>I’m not saying all millionaire bloggers respond to email, because they don’t, but more of them will. It’s why they’re making money, they respond to every question or at least most.</p>
<p><b>Why? You never know where this conversation could be going. </b></p>
<p>Besides, you should want to reply. <b>It’s exciting!</b> To think, someone is reaching out to you and wanting to hear from you. It should thrill you. When you get to the point that you feel like your readers are a nuisance though… You won’t be in business for long. So <b>make it #1 priority</b> and answer every email.</p>
<p>Apply these and your list will grow within time. Hope you have walked away with some fresh ideas and spark some more creativity within your tribe.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This is a guest contribution from entrepreneur <a href="http://suitcaseentrepreneur.com/freedomplan" target="_blank">Natalie Sisson</a>.</em></p>
<p>So, you want to turn your blog into an online business?</p>
<p>Congratulations, so does every other person with wifi.</p>
<p>Now, I don’t mean to to bust your buns right off the get go, but if I’m being honest (and I always am!) then you need to know one thing:</p>
<p><strong>A blog that doesn’t make money is a hobby, and a hobby is not a business.</strong></p>
<p>The truth is, many of us don’t know what we’re doing when we’re first starting out online. Learning how to create a website, identify your ideal customer and convert them into sales will be a process, one that I am here to help you with though.</p>
<p>First things first; when you think of your website does it make you proud? If you are uncomfortable sharing your url with friends and family because it looks horrendous, then chances are your audience will be thinking the same thing.</p>
<p>Have you ever heard the theory that when shopping, if you hold an item for 10 seconds or longer you are more likely to buy? Well, the same principle goes for websites, but you have far less time to convert them &#8211; you have four seconds, to be exact.</p>
<p>A lot can happen in four seconds, which is why you need to make the most of it. If your viewer can’t find what they’re looking for, then they will surely go elsewhere. So how do you grab their attention and keep them on your site? It all starts by <strong>building a connection</strong>.</p>
<p>Every great relationship revolves around feeling a fundamental connection between two people. In this case, you need to build the foundation between your website and your audience. One of the best ways you can do this is to ask yourself what the primary goal of your website is.</p>
<p>Since your website is a platform to introduce yourself and your products to the world, knowing exactly what you mean to sell or achieve from having the site will help you target the ideal target audience.</p>
<p>The easiest way to convey this message is by creating a crisp, clear homepage. Your homepage is basically a landing page for any and all visitors. It will be the first thing they see, so capture them in those four quick seconds.</p>
<p><strong>A few key tricks for ensuring a stellar home page is to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Choose a clear web design &#8211; the more hectic your layout, the more likely your visitor will bounce</li>
<li>When asking your audience to opt-in to a free mailing list or free download, create one simple, to-the-point call to action</li>
<li>No one likes getting lost, so make navigating your site simple. Have a clear menu at the top so visitors can easily find their way around</li>
<li>Selling a product or service? Make it evident on the homepage. The harder they have to look for it, the more likely they will go to your competition</li>
<li>Outline what it is you’re all about. I’m not talking a novel, but one clear paragraph about who you are, what you stand for and what you’re offering</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Now, to really start converting your audience you’re going to want to check off these next five steps from your to-do list.</strong></p>
<h2>1. Determine what it is you are selling</h2>
<p>What do you feel jazzed about making money from? Whether it’s a product or a service you are are going to want to make this particular item forefront on your homepage.</p>
<p>Many people make the mistake of offering several different service on their homepage and it only confuses their visitor. For example, if you really wanted to sell business coaching, but offered website design coaching and business coaching on your homepage, how would they know which to choose?</p>
<p>Besides the fact that these two products sound beyond similar, why would you offer something you aren’t keen on doing yourself? Take away the option by simply promoting one service on you homepage.</p>
<h2>2. Keep it clean</h2>
<p>Some people just don’t know when to call it quits when it comes to web design. If you’ve ever happened across a site that seems to be hoarding widgets, images, links and more, then you know how unappealing and distracting that is to the eye.</p>
<p>Too much distraction will confuse and deter your visitor from becoming a sale. So here’s what you should do:<br />
Remove any external links from your homepage that take them off your site<br />
Choose social widgets that allow them to like your content without leaving your site<br />
Avoid flashy text or image that takes their attention away from the product you want them to purchase</p>
<p>Are you starting to see a pattern here?</p>
<h2>3. Implement a sales funnel</h2>
<p>Your sales funnel should start on your homepage. That little chunk of screen you see when you land (referred to as ‘above the fold’) there should contain everything you need to compel your visitor to buy what you are selling.</p>
<p>Using your best copy, image, video or what-have-you to convey the many benefits of your product should all be visible here. To further resonate with your audience, feel free to direct them to your About page so they can get to know you and strengthen your bond together.</p>
<h2>4. Make buying simple</h2>
<p>You may have convinced them to buy, but if you make it difficult to pay that is a surefire way to lose a sale.</p>
<p>The easiest way to rectify this situation is to have a &#8220;buy now&#8221; option on your landing page; and be sure to make them feel safe when buying from you. To do that make sure you use and advertise a secure shopping cart option, like Paypal. A money back guarantee always helps solidify the sale as well.</p>
<h2>5. Make sure your new landing page is working</h2>
<p>I have no doubt that if you managed to follow the first four steps you will have created one heck of a landing page. Now that it’s there, it’s time to find out if it’s converting, which is where analytics comes in.</p>
<ul>
<li>Set yourself up with a free Google Analytics account and add in the tracking code to your website. Every few weeks head back to that analytics dashboard and see:</li>
<li>How many unique (read, first time) monthly users are visiting your site</li>
<li>Where they are coming from, aka. traffic source</li>
<li>Your average bounce rate &#8211; how long they stay on your site before leaving</li>
<li>Which page exactly your visitors tend to exit your website from the most &#8211; visitor exit</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t need to be a geek to be able to read this data. For example, if you’re traffic is mainly mobile then make sure that you are using a mobile-optimized web theme. On the other hand, if your visitors continually exit on your product sales page, it’s time to think about doing a redesign.</p>
<p>With these five strategies, there is no doubt in my mind that you will be able to turn your current website into a cash converting sales machine.</p>
<p>Now tell me; what is the biggest change you need to make to your website after learning these steps? <strong>Share your thoughts and progress in the comment section.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mr_t_in_dc/5323104963/"><img class="size-full wp-image-28611 alignleft" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/5323104963_50c0b027111.jpg" alt="5323104963_50c0b02711" width="356" height="500" /></a></p>
<p style="color: #222222;"><i>You are getting sleepy…very sleepy…</i></p>
<p style="color: #222222;">That&#8217;s typically what comes to mind when you think of hypnosis—a stage show with some unfortunate soul doing the chicken-dance. However, those who practice hypnosis are quick to give a proper explanation.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Here’s the textbook definition: <i>The induction of a state of consciousness in which a person becomes highly responsive to suggestion or direction.</i></p>
<p style="color: #222222;">We enter into hypnotic states on a daily basis; completely absorbed in an activity and losing track of time. It happens when you drive, when you watch movies, and—when you read.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Hypnosis feeds off the psychosomatic power of words. An <a style="color: #1155cc;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_mVFPCaQJY" target="_blank"><span style="color: #2557ad;">intriguing study</span></a> in Malcolm Gladwell’s <i>Blink </i>highlights the mind-body relationship inherent in words. Subjects were lead into a room, asked to describe how they felt. Then, they were told to read a list of words: “worried,” “Florida,” “old,” “lonely,” “grey,” “sentimental,” “bingo,” “withdraw,” “forgetful,” “retired,” “wrinkle.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Afterward, subjects not only described feeling slow and sluggish, but physically walked out of the room slower than when they entered. In psychology, it’s referred to as <i>Priming</i>, in hypnosis it’s synonymous with “embedding a command.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">This fascinating link between words and physiology is often exploited by the advertising and marketing industries. Words are carefully crafted to evoke powerful emotions and a state of higher suggestibility.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Exploitation occurs because something is so effective. That effectiveness can certainly be applied to the article you&#8217;re about to write.</p>
<h2 style="color: #222222;">As you write, here are five hypnotic strategies to put into place:</h2>
<h3 style="color: #222222;">1. Poetic Meter</h3>
<p style="color: #222222;">Ever wondered why Shakespeare’s work is so mesmerising? He uses iambic pentameter heavily throughout his plays and sonnets. Pentameters indicate the rhythm of spoken words; iambic being the most common in English poetry. The rhythm of poetry captures us, and can be applied to writing.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Think of the <i>da-DUM</i> rhythm of the heartbeat and the <i>tic-TOCK</i> of a clock. The unstressed syllable followed by the stressed syllable is the iambic pentameter. It’s not only our feet, but also our minds that cannot help tapping to the beat. Here’s the first line of Shakespeare’s 12th Sonnet:</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">When I / do COUNT / the CLOCK / that TELLS / the TIME</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Let’s be clear, this isn’t a challenge to try and turn all your articles in poetic pieces, but if you are able to bring more of a rhythmic and poetic flow to your writing, you’ll certainly be more engaging.</p>
<h3 style="color: #222222;">2. Active Voice VS. Passive Voice</h3>
<p style="color: #222222;">Research and academic writing is general done with the passive voice—hence they’re so tedious to read. The focus is always placed on object—the evidence, findings, and results, rather than the subject—the person doing the research.  Hypnotic writing is all about the subject; always use the present active voice when structuring your subject and verbs.  The “now” engages people much more than the past or future.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Notice the difference between:</p>
<p style="color: #222222;"><i>The brakes were slammed on by Stacey at the red lights.</i></p>
<p style="color: #222222;">and,</p>
<p style="color: #222222;"><i>Stacey slammed on the brakes at the red lights.</i></p>
<h3 style="color: #222222;">3. Personal Stories</h3>
<p style="color: #222222;">Everybody loves movies. Great stories are universal across all cultures because they allow for human empathy. When you share a personal story or experience in your articles, people respond with, “Oh yeah, I remember when that happened to me!” Or they can at least imagine what that&#8217;d be like.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">A story brings you into a different setting. You’re suddenly detached from sitting on a chair and looking at your laptop to immersed in the scenario presented. <a style="color: #1155cc;" href="http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1580438,00.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: #2557ad;">Studies</span></a> show that when we engage our imagination, the lines between what’s mentally constructed and what is real gets very blurry. A person who imagines practicing piano experiences similar neurological effect as one who physically does.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Use stories in your writing to activate your reader’s imagination and immerse them into hypnotic experience. Simply starting off a sentence with “Imagine…” will get the ball rolling.</p>
<h3 style="color: #222222;">4. “You.” Yes, You.</h3>
<p style="color: #222222;">“You” makes readers feel as though your article is directly speaking to them. Although you&#8217;re writing articles in hope of having it read by millions, you certainly don’t want to sound that broard and generalised. That create a canyon of disconnect. You want to sound as though you’re having a personal one-on-one conversation with your reader.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">There’s a psychological principle called the <i>Fundamental Attribution Error</i>—you’ll be furious and disgusted when you see someone texting and driving, but oh-so forgiving as you drive and text away. Our critical factors are on high alert when we analyse others, but take a break when we analyse ourselves.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">If you write as though addressing a broad audience, you’ll have to fight through the critical factor, the more you are able to be personal, the more engaged your uncritical reader will be.</p>
<h3 style="color: #222222;">5. Explanations.</h3>
<p style="color: #222222;"><i>“Why is that so?”</i></p>
<p style="color: #222222;">“Because” is your key word here. Humans have curiosity hardwired into us, we’re always searching for answers and justification. Addressing problems and creating curiosity in your writing is crucial, but even more so is providing a resolution and explanation.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The classic <a style="color: #1155cc;" href="http://www.ellenlanger.com/blog/141/mind-power" target="_blank"><span style="color: #2557ad;">“Xerox copy” study</span></a> by Harvard psychologist Ellen Langer demonstrated the power of simply giving an explanation. The set-up was a student attempting to cut in line for the copier:</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">In the first scenario, she asked &#8220;Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine?&#8221; 60% allowed her to cut-in line.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The second scenario was more specific and asked, &#8220;Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I&#8217;m in a rush?&#8221; The numbers shot up to 94%.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The third scenario is the most surprising: &#8220;Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I have to make some copies?&#8221; The numbers stayed about the same at 93% even with a redundant and ridiculous explanation.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">A well written and hypnotic lead-in will create enough momentum for the reader to come to a climactic “Why?” But as the study shows, we’re profoundly responsive to explanations, and not presenting an explanation is like switching off a movie before the big ending.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;"><em><span style="color: #373737;">The power of words to evoke positive change motivates Thai to write. Previously a professional chef and international athlete, he’s now somewhere in the world with a backpack, MacBook, and a story to share.

<p>Do you struggle for content inspiration? Do you feel like every article you write is exactly like another you’ve already written or read?</p>
<p>You’re falling victim to content stagnation, and it’s something we all deal with.</p>
<p>Perhaps you need a refresher, a reminder, or just someone to give you a <a title="Content Week: How to Consistently Come up With Great Post Ideas for Your Blog." href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2014/02/03/content-week-how-to-consistently-come-up-with-great-post-ideas-for-your-blog/">few new ideas </a>- a nudge along the way.</p>
<p>This article will give a full look at how to encourage and capture readership, optimize for action and engagement, and get the most out of your content &#8211; the full gamut of content marketing best practice.</p>
<p>I’ll refocus you on the five steps that you need to take to create interesting content that get shares, comments, engagement and loyal readers as well as content that generates leads.</p>
<p>Let’s make sure you’re doing this content creation thing right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Step #1 to Creating Awesome Content: Grab their Attention</h2>
<p>I wish I could tell you that the title of your content doesn’t matter anymore, that your content’s readers, visitors, viewers and listeners have grown more discerning in the past couple years and now it’s all about the quality of your content: the expertise, experience and analysis you throw painstakingly into each and every article, podcast, video and presentation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I can’t do that for you.</p>
<p>Your content’s title is hugely important to its success &#8211; not just because of search optimization but for clickability, shareability and engage-ability.</p>
<p>Without a title that snaps, grabs the eye, intrigues, frustrates, scares or humors, your content will fall flat on its face, no matter that it’s the second coming of Gangnam Style.</p>

<h2>Step #2 to Creating Awesome Content: Optimize for More than SEO</h2>
<p>It’s taken me a bit too long to accept this fact, but fact it is nonetheless: SEO is antiquated and incomplete, a universal term of use we should steer away from.</p>
<p>Let me back that up, because I hear some of our SEO readers sharpening their pitchforks and lighting their torches.</p>
<p>Optimizing your content for search is still hugely important, but we should stop using it as an umbrella phrase when what we actually mean is optimizing <b>for readership, engagement and conversion.</b></p>
<h3><b>Optimizing your Content for Readership:</b></h3>
<p>This is the general SEO stuff: the strategies we implement to get our content to the top of the front page of Google.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use H1s (title) and H2s (sub-headers) and where applicable. Ensure these include keywords.</li>
<li>Put alt text on your content’s images and videos relevant to the content’s subject.</li>
<li>Avoid keyword stuffing (keep it to about 1 in 25, depending on sector).</li>
<li>Place <a href="http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2067564/How-To-Use-HTML-Meta-Tags">meta tags</a> within your content.</li>
<li>Consider long-tail search keywords and niche topics (rather than competing with the corporations).</li>
<li>Link intelligently by including keywords in your links. Never use “Click &lt;here&gt; for more information”. Instead use, “Learn more about SEO in my article &lt;<a href="http://blog.wishpond.com/post/65898762922/blog-seo-how-to-easily-optimize-your-blog-for-search">How to Easily Optimize your Blog for Search</a>&gt;” (see how I did that?).</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Optimizing your Content for Engagement:</b></h3>
<p>Content engagement, also known as social shares and comments, is not only important because of the Hummingbird Algorithm (Google’s update to SEO a year ago that placed more importance on social endorsements) but because the more your content is shared, the more readers you have. Duh!</p>
<ul>
<li>Have <a href="http://blog.wishpond.com/post/60276168559/10-sure-fire-blog-title-formulas-that-attract-readers">a title optimized for SEO</a> and another title optimized for social platforms (shorter, more Buzzfeed-like). Include one in your URL and a different one in your social toolbars.</li>
<li>Ensure your content’s header is social-friendly so it shows up whole on Facebook, Google+ and LinkedIn.</li>
<li>Include “Tweetable” statistics or takeaways (with a link) throughout your content to encourage a specific social share.</li>
<li>Ask for questions, comments or examples from your readers at the end of articles.</li>
<li>Be an active commenter on other people’s sites (as well as your own).</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Optimizing your Content for Conversion:</b></h3>
<p>We’re blogging for business here, not musing about the trials and tribulations of maternity (unless you are&#8230; In which case you still need to be optimizing your content for conversion!)</p>
<p>Think about it, is there any real point in your article being at the top of Google’s search results or having a million readers a week if nobody’s acting on your CTA buttons, downloading your ebooks, registering for a free trial or subscribing to your email list?</p>
<p>No. No there’s not.</p>
<p><b>Here are a few ways you can optimize your content for a real-world conversion (something that helps your business in a concrete, measurable way):</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Include links to your email-gated content on the sidebar and bottom of your blog articles, podcasts, webinars and Slideshares.</li>
<li>Implement <a href="http://corp.wishpond.com/pop-ups/">click pop-ups</a> and email subscription toolbars so readers or viewers don’t have to be sent to a separate landing page and tab to convert.</li>
<li>Don’t link to competitors.</li>
<li>Link to related articles and resources on your site (increasing the value of engagement) and external content where you’re business is mentioned (increasing the level of trust and authority).</li>
<li>Test CTA button copy to determine what “Ask” resonates most with your readers.</li>
<li>Implement <a href="http://wishpond.com/pop-ups">exit pop-ups</a> promoting email-gated content relevant to your content’s subject matter. For instance, implement an exit pop-up with “want to learn everything there is to know about landing pages?” and show it to unique visitors (once!) as they go to leave the page.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-05-at-10.40.43-am.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-32090" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-05-at-10.40.43-am.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-09-05 at 10.40.43 am" width="211" height="341" /></a></p>
<h2>Step #3 to Creating Awesome Content: Format Your Article Intelligently</h2>
<p>The longer you can keep a reader looking at your page, the less likely they are to leave it, the more likely they are to share it, and the more likely they are to convert on one of your “Asks” spread across your optimized blog.</p>
<p>Your title, hook and introduction get them to stay for the first 10 seconds (the most crucial section of your article as, if they stay for more than 10 seconds, the chance of them leaving drops like a rock):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-05-at-10.41.26-am.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-32091" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-05-at-10.41.26-am.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-09-05 at 10.41.26 am" width="468" height="327" /></a></p>
<p>Beyond those first ten seconds, your articles (or podcasts or webinars) needs to be structured to encourage readers to stick with it and stay engaged.</p>
<h3><b>Here are a few best practices that will help you do that:</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>Segment your articles with bold, clearly visible subheaders that grab the eye of your reader.</li>
<li>Include an image once every segment (if possible) to keep the reader visually stimulated.</li>
<li>Use bullet-points or numbered lists in your sections to communicate your message or advice clearly and quickly. This also increases the chance that someone skim reading will pause for a moment.</li>
<li>In both podcasts and webinars, give a short breakdown of the points you’re going to cover at the beginning</li>
<li>Where possible, include exclusive tips and tricks (in all types of content) that you tease your audience with at the beginning and only include at the end. In webinars and podcasts, test hiding your big secret without telling people when exactly it&#8217;s going to be.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Step #4 to Creating Awesome Content: Incorporate Awesome Images</h2>
<p>Articles with images are shared twice as much as those without.</p>
<p>But I’d like to emphasize that it’s not just any image that encourages a share or keeps a reader scrolling. You have to be using awesome images.</p>
<p>Put time into original image content (even if you’re just drawing over and citing someone else’s pie chart). Put time into getting to know PhotoShop, GIMP, even Google Drawings or Presentations.</p>
<p><b>For instance, I made this with the Google Presentation tool in about 6 minutes:</b></p>
<p><a href="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-05-at-10.43.35-am.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-32092" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-05-at-10.43.35-am.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-09-05 at 10.43.35 am" width="360" height="257" /></a></p>
<p>I know. It’s awesome.</p>
<p>Images not only encourage social sharing, communicate data and statistics quickly and grab the eye of the reader, they also humanize your business and make your articles more visually appealing and scrollable.</p>
<p>When used badly, however, they can cause your readers to go elsewhere, your articles to flop socially, and your authority to decrease significantly.</p>
<p>Stock images, for instance, are increasingly recognizable for what they are. As a result, they’re increasingly becoming one of <a href="http://blog.wishpond.com/post/95288484760/the-psychology-of-your-bounce-rate-and-7-ways-to-fight">the chief causes of a page bounce</a>:</p>
<p>I mean, c’mon:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-05-at-10.44.26-am1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-32095" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-05-at-10.44.26-am1.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-09-05 at 10.44.26 am" width="600" height="236" /></a><br />
Put that little bit more time into your content. Find the Google Images “Labeled for Reuse” or subscribe to one of the million photo sites and use the least “stocky” images you can find.</p>
<p>And don’t force an image. They should always serve a purpose (as “teamwork” rarely, if ever, would above). Instead, communicate the stuff that adds to the value of your article (statistics, case studies, industry report findings, etc) in a visually appealing way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Step #5 to Creating Awesome Content: Be Unique</h2>
<p>Content audiences (the people that listen, read and watch your content) are fickle creatures. They’re skim-readers, hyped up on coffee with not enough time on their hands and an urgent desire to, essentially, channel-surf content.</p>
<p>Channel surfing is actually a pretty solid analogy now that I think about it.</p>
<p>Your content audience is like a TV watcher before we had Netflix: sitting slouched on their couch hitting the “up” button on their remote control, searching for something they haven’t seen before. More often than not they’re disappointed (as your “10 Marketing Best Practices You Haven’t Seen Before” article is a blatant lie).</p>
<p>But sometimes they land on your article, give it the standard three seconds, and decide they’ll put the remote control down on the couch, cross their arms, and watch.</p>
<p>But how do you ensure your content engages your reader more than the other 100,000 shows on TV right now?</p>
<h3><b>Tell a Story:</b></h3>
<p>People like content relevant to them. Even more than that they like content relevant to them written by an author recognizable to them with a story they can relate to. The more <i>like</i> your reader you can be, the better your content will be.</p>
<p>That’s not to say you don’t have to tie your story into genuine, professional analysis of changes or best practices in your sector &#8211; but make it interesting and make it recognizable.</p>
<h3><b>Be Honest:</b></h3>
<p>Transparency in marketing is becoming best practice (just look at <a href="http://open.bufferapp.com/introducing-open-salaries-at-buffer-including-our-transparent-formula-and-all-individual-salaries/">Buffer</a> if you want to know what I’m talking about). It’s about being an open, honest, modern company &#8211; a company that plays foil to the murky, underground goings-on of multinational corporate giants or the federal government.</p>
<p><b>Consider articles entitled something like:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>“5 Lead Generations That are Working for Us Right Now”</li>
<li>“The 10 A/B Testing Mistakes I Tried that Failed Miserably, and Why”</li>
<li>“10 TImes I was the Mayor of Fashion Faux Pas City”</li>
<li>“5 Divorce Mistakes I Wish I’d Known About”</li>
<li>“A Step-By-Step Guide to Our Sales Funnel”</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Be Yourself:</b></h3>
<p>What is it about you as a content creator that sets you above your competitors. Is it your ability to pump out content, your silky-smooth podcast voice, or your never-ending anecdotes that entertain and educate?</p>
<p>Increasingly your content audience is looking for something to differentiate you (and your content) from that of your competitors. It’s like when applying for university or a job: readers are receiving thousands of applications every day and they’re struggling to separate the wheat from the chaff.</p>
<p>Here’s what I recommend: make your application bright pink, printed on poster paper, covered in golden glitter, or make it a pop-up book. Do something that sets you apart.</p>
<p><b>A few recommendations to set your content apart:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Become a visuals guru, incorporating awesome graphics into every one of your articles, videos, webinars and ebooks. It might take you longer, but it’s worth testing the ROI.</li>
<li>Create a content persona, mascot or alter ego &#8211; something to make your content entertaining.</li>
<li>Find the niche in your niche, and own it. Be the go-to expert on a specific part of your sector.</li>
</ul>
<p>Or, honestly, just get creative every once in a while (I’m not talking about every single article) but test adding personality to your content periodically to see what kind of return you get.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Hopefully that’s given you a refresher course (or even an educational one) on how to optimize your content for readership, engagement and loyalty.</p>
<p>Content marketing is officially (there’s no arguing anymore) the best way to increase your business’ online profile, generate leads and ensure brand authority. It can be a challenge though, don’t get me wrong.</p>
<p>My main recommendation for creating content that snaps, crackles and pops is to put time into how you start your article. Focus on finding the right topic, the right title, the right structure and the right way to make it <i>different.</i> Then start writing.</p>

<p><span style="color: #222222;">Every time we encounter the phrase &#8220;project management&#8221;, the very first thought you might have is that only businesses undertake projects for managing their needs. In reality, time-bound activities can be dealt as a project, irrespective of size. A wedding, opening a small store in a city, renovating an old home or a dumped caravan are all projects. They all require planning, have limited time, have cost and have a deliverable or objective. So, if we consider some of our daily personal activities or blog work as projects, we can apply principles of project management to enable us to measure success in our life, derive personal satisfaction, have better blogs, be better planners, and happier human beings.</span></p>
<h2>Top 10 useful tools for enhanced management and tracking of personal projects:</h2>
<h3><a href="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-09-05-at-9.26.02-am.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-32068" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-09-05-at-9.26.02-am-1024x437.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-09-05 at 9.26.02 am" width="600" height="257" /></a></h3>
<h3>Basecamp</h3>
<p><span style="color: #222222;">Tasks needing to be performed in a personal project can be properly listed through to-dos in <a href="http://basecamp.com/" target="_blank">Basecamp</a>. These tasks can be assigned to different people participating in a project and can be checked off on their completion. It is so easy to view which activities happened in a project in a given time span. Relevant files and documents can be attached to threads. Important emails like bills can be forwarded to Basecamp, making it easy to search them from the heap of emails. Text documents help to track things which keep changing frequently with time like menus, gift cards, etc. Basecamp lacks time tracking, so it cannot be precisely known how much time was spent in executing various tasks in a project, which can be cruscial knowledge. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-09-05-at-9.27.32-am.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-32069" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-09-05-at-9.27.32-am-1024x453.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-09-05 at 9.27.32 am" width="600" height="266" /></a></p>
<h3>ProofHub</h3>
<p><span style="color: #222222;">Personal projects can be smoothly managed with <a href="http://www.proofhub.com/" target="_blank">this</a> online collaboration and project management tool. Important events like birthdays and anniversaries can be effectively planned and conducted as scheduled. People subscribed to events receive reminders in advance. Recurring events like get-togethers can be arranged on a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly basis. As tasks can be assigned to multiple people, so it becomes far easier to assign and distribute work among a group of family members or friends. This way everyone is clear about his respective tasks in a celebratory event. Labels like &#8220;in-progress&#8221;, &#8220;completed&#8221; and &#8220;high priority&#8221; can be assigned to the tasks, which helps to plan and track them in an easy manner. Deadlines can be set for tasks, so these can be performed in a time bound manner. Collaborators in a project can conveniently discuss matters concerning them. They can better share their views and ideas, and images. Any number o f people can be added as contacts into a project.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-09-05-at-9.30.16-am.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-32070" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-09-05-at-9.30.16-am-1024x490.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-09-05 at 9.30.16 am" width="600" height="287" /></a></p>
<h3>Asana</h3>
<p><span style="color: #222222;">​<a href="https://asana.com/" target="_blank">Asana </a>allows creation of separate workspaces for personal and professional projects, making it great for organizing all types of projects. Have calls to make? A shopping list? Throw it all in a workspace or project. Each project has its own sharing controls, so you can have a party shopping list with your roommates while organizing a wedding party with your family. You can even make your projects public. The Asana mobile applications make it even more easier to access your shopping list on the go and your friends busy in other arrangements, can easily track activities within seconds.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-09-05-at-9.32.18-am.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-32071" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-09-05-at-9.32.18-am-1024x447.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-09-05 at 9.32.18 am" width="600" height="262" /></a></p>
<h3>Trello</h3>
<p><span style="color: #222222;"><a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank">​Trello</a> is great for personal use. It consist of boards comprising one or more named lists to keep track of all the tasks. Trello’s power lies in assigning multiple people to a board. Comments can be added to the cards, allowing discussions on various topics. This tool does not provide the chat feature that could have facilitated communication and collaboration among people, though.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-09-05-at-9.34.22-am.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-32072" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-09-05-at-9.34.22-am-1024x500.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-09-05 at 9.34.22 am" width="600" height="293" /></a></p>
<h3>Teamwork​</h3>
<p><span style="color: #222222;">​Assigning tasks to collaborators involved in a personal project can be properly done with <a href="https://www.teamwork.com/" target="_blank">this</a> tool. The priority for a specific task can be set and it can be known how much percentage of a task has been completed. Task reminders can be set. Recurring tasks can be created and tasks can be rendered private if required. Time spent over tasks can be recorded. Tasks can also be rescheduled. Collaborators participating in projects are able to communicate smoothly through messages. They can attach files. Improved task management and smoother communication enables successful accomplishment of personal projects.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-09-05-at-9.36.25-am.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-32073" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-09-05-at-9.36.25-am.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-09-05 at 9.36.25 am" width="600" height="347" /></a></p>
<h3>Podio</h3>
<p><span style="color: #222222;">​People are able to collaborate on <a href="https://podio.com/" target="_blank">Podio</a> over personal projects through workspaces which can be rendered open or private. Tasks can be better defined and assigned to concerned people. Reminders can be set to know if tasks have been completed within the defined time. Recurring, shared and personal tasks can be created. Files can be shared from any remote location. Distantly located collaborators have more clarity over tasks assigned to them. So they are able to execute their tasks within the limited time frame. This tool is quite useful for organized management over projects.</span></p>
<h3><a href="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-09-05-at-9.38.50-am.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-32075" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-09-05-at-9.38.50-am-1024x431.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-09-05 at 9.38.50 am" width="600" height="253" /></a></h3>
<h3>Wrike</h3>
<p><span style="color: #222222;">​The highlight of this project management tool is that tasks can be easily created from emails and can be discussed upon with ease. Priorities can be set for tasks and these can be executed in a scheduled manner. Progress achieved in a project can be precisely monitored in real time. So projects can be better organized and managed. Collaborators in personal projects are able to execute their assigned tasks in an orderly and scheduled manner. They can know the exact percentage of progress achieved in projects. This tool’s limitation is that it incurs a lot of time and effort in learning how to use it properly.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-09-05-at-9.41.07-am.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-32076" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-09-05-at-9.41.07-am-1024x517.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-09-05 at 9.41.07 am" width="600" height="303" /></a></p>
<h3>AtTask</h3>
<p><span style="color: #222222;">​Tasks can be better managed, organized and viewed at the same place through this task management software. Tasks and their due dates can be easily edited. Resources can be properly allocated to people in personal projects, so they do not get overloaded or underloaded with work. They are able to communicate smoothly. They can access documents from the same location and share them. Through feedback, they can be lauded for good work done by them. Reports help to keep everyone updated in projects without putting strain on the inbox. Time spent in projects and tasks can be accurately logged which enables accurate billing. The disadvantage of AtTask is that though users can comment on specific tasks, but there is no earmarked area solely for discussions.</span></p>

<h3>Comindware</h3>
<p><span style="color: #222222;">​This work management software improves collaboration among people working together in projects. Messages, attachments and actions in a project can be arranged in a structured manner in group discussions. This improves organization over projects. It also has the mobile feature, so users can participate in discussions while on the go. So personal projects can be better organized, managed and executed. Users can readily share documents with each other.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-09-05-at-9.43.53-am.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-32078" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-09-05-at-9.43.53-am-1024x513.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-09-05 at 9.43.53 am" width="600" height="301" /></a></p>
<h3>Smartsheet</h3>
<p><span style="color: #222222;">​With this tool, personal projects can be effectively managed through simple task lists. People participating in such projects are able to attach files and set alerts. Due dates for tasks can be set. Tasks can be viewed and edited in calendar. Status details or brief notes can be added to tasks for more clarity over them. People participating in a personal project are able to collaborate in real time. Status of tasks can be viewed and updated even on the go through mobile app. The disadvantage of this tool is that it offers no solutions for time management.</span><br />
<br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">In summary, on encountering the word project management, we naturally think that only businesses need to manage projects. In reality, big or small activities can be dealt as projects as they all require planning, got limited time, have cost, deliverable or objective associated with them. By considering our daily activities as projects, principles of project management can be applied on them. So we can be better planners and happier human beings. Project management tools like Basecamp, ProofHub Asana, Trello, Teamwork, Podio, Wrike, AtTask, Comindware and Smartsheet can be employed for improved management and precise tracking of personal projects.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">So, you have a new business &#8211; a new product to market. So now what&#8217;s next? Perhaps you are thinking about getting traffic, or how to have more visitors to your website? If so, then expect that your mind will be abuzz with terms such as social media, SEO, AdWords, videos, banner ads, articles, etc. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Or, it will be empty and blank.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-22-at-2.09.20-pm.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31698" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-22-at-2.09.20-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-08-22 at 2.09.20 pm" width="625" height="277" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Focus</i>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Search Engines are what you need, despite all the buzz about social media. <i>Google</i>, <i>Yahoo</i>, and <i>Bing</i> remain a main source of traffic for many people. </span>SEO can help you get there, simple as that. However, SEO is often confused with different technical tactics. If you are a search engine marketer,the tactic sounds technical, spammy, and secretive &#8211; it&#8217;s not worth your time. One great SEO strategy that works best in search engine marketing is making your website a valuable resource. But, before going into it deeper, let me discuss first the importance of having a good SEO strategy.</p>
<h2 class="p1"></h2>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>SEO Strategy and Its Importance </b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SEO is the first concern when talking about traffic- despite the presence of social media. But what can you do and how are you supposed to do it to have the traffic you&#8217;ve been wanting for a long time?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It has been a common trap to get caught up in various tactics. These tactics, for the most part, may hurt your reputation, and worse &#8211; won&#8217;t work. If you focus on pleasing the people as your prime concern, you&#8217;ll end up ignoring SEO strategy and still be fine. But, this is not what search engine marketing is all about! Getting to grips with SEO the right way is a major help. There is no need to complicate things, just don&#8217;t ignore them. Among the many strategies that Search Engine Marketers employ to take the business higher, one of the most ignored is to make the website a valuable resource &#8211; making the website a one-stop spot for everyone and let users leave satisfied they found everything they wanted.</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>The Strategy: Make the Website A Valuable Resource </b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The best SEO geeks at present focus on how they can please the people first, then, the search engine. The key point is that, you can actually do well in SEO by creating content that people would want to save, bookmark, share, comment on, and make as a reference. When you can make this happen, this would indicate that they see your content to be useful and they want it to be a reference for future use. This is what the search engine is looking for and in return, it will reward your content with higher rankings.</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Custom Google Analytics </b></span></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-22-at-2.22.04-pm.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31699" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-22-at-2.22.04-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-08-22 at 2.22.04 pm" width="625" height="312" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To intensify this strategy, you can make use of custom Google Analytics to give you an idea of your useful content and make a difference by serving as a reference material that will be of great help in solving your readers&#8217; concerns and needs. Being reference material is good for ranking, given that it is likely to be shared, clipped, and linked to &#8211; a long-term value for your website.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Additionally, being a valuable resource will serve as a foundation for your content marketing strategy. Being a “valuable resource” may not sound as sexy as “engaging content” or “going viral”, but sure thing, it is a much better way to spend your time on, more so when you are just starting out.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Investing a significant amount of time on using SEO the right way is a must. There might be so many strategies around, but not all of them will be applicable to what you can offer to the people. It&#8217;s time to be picky &#8211; make sure that you&#8217;ll stay immortal on the web and people will always be craving what you have in store for them.</span></p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><em>This is a guest contribution from Maria Mincey</em>.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Based on <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/5014/Study-Shows-Business-Blogging-Leads-to-55-More-Website-Visitors.aspx" target="_blank">study by HubSpot</a>, the companies that run a business blog have 97% more inbound links. Now, that&#8217;s a statistic that should set rolling the blogging mills of enterprises – be them startups or multinationals. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Official blogs have had proven benefits for businesses. The very fact that they jazz up the monotonous tone with which a brand is communicating to its audience, and replace it with a line of communication that is much core connective and personal, is what makes business blogs a priceless asset. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are several ways blogs benefit businesses, two of which are more than obvious:</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>It Maximizes Reach</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A blog helps companies reach a much broader customer base than their website would. Let&#8217;s be honest, how many people bother going to the website of a particular brand or a product they have been using? The websites of companies have to be restricted to providing business-centric information and advertise the offerings of the company. Every bit of information provided on the blog is static, and that is the singularly most relevant reason for your visitors to be totally disinterested in the website, even if they liked to navigate through it on their first visit. Having a blog makes your site dynamic as you keep giving newer insights to the readers and tell a story about your brand.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>It Boosts Incoming Traffic by Not just By Intriguing Readers, But also by Enhancing the SEO Aspects</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Naturally, when the blog section of your site is offering your readers something new to read, you are bound to get more number of repeat-visits; not to mention the greater number of unique visits as the blog gets shared and liked across the web. But another contributor to this increasing traffic is the optimization of the SEO capability of the website. When you are making quality writers write content for the blog, they know how to write interesting articles while injecting the relevant keywords that is identifiable for your target audience and also let the search engines crawl your website with a greater degree of eagerness and direct a higher volume to the site. You can add only so much of keywords to your product website. </span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Which Blogging Platform to Use?</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There isn&#8217;t a dearth of highly popular and effort-worthy blogging platforms out there. However, if you wish the blog to click into the top gear right away, there is no need to look beyond WordPress. Acc. to more stats:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">WordPress is the most sought-after CMS as more than 19% of the self-hosted websites are running on it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">More than 17% of Alexa&#8217;s top million websites use WordPress.</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Now Before You Start, Why do you want to Blog in the First Place?</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are also brands who fail to get the desired results they&#8217;d expected their blog to pour in for them. Reason: their blogging strategy was too haphazard and there was hardly a plan into the place regarding who are they targeting and how many numbers they hope to achieve. Apparently, the blogs were headed for doom from the very first day due to the lack of insightful approach.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here are the questions you, as a company blogger or entrepreneur, need to as yourself:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Who is your target audience?</li>
<li>What percentage of that blog audience is prospective buyers?</li>
<li>What do they really want to read (what should be the mix of company related info, the industry related info and the interesting bits that only remotely connect to your brand)?</li>
<li>What should be the frequency of your posts?</li>
<li>How good is your networking?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unless you have a clear-eyed answer to each of these questions, it is advisable to wait</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Know What You Have to Write</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is understandable if you find yourself scrambling for topics to write on or deciding on how to structure your posts. But there are several things to be tried out:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Create the “best of ….” style posts. Such posts do command attention and get a lot of clicks. If written in a qualitative manner, they also get shared over the social media.</li>
<li>Post reviews, but not just of your products. Let&#8217;s say you are running a blog for a job portal. You can post a review of some movie that has released recently that is themed around careers and accounts for some relevance to what you represent.</li>
<li>Interview the influencers in your industry. People love to read interviews, and they are going to do their bit to boost the traffic.</li>
<li>Crowd source your content. When you ask your readers to be your contributors, and if and when they contribute, they are going to boost the site visits by sharing their own content among their circle.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Have some really interesting titles and subtitles for the articles in order for them to take hold of the readers. There is a large section of Internet users who like to just scan the content by reading only titles and subtitles – and more often than not, they only segue onto the subsequent content if they find the subtitle intriguing enough.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Again, on the Internet, shorter paragraphs would mean more attention span.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Do make sure that you break your post into bullet points in order to make it more readable.</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Get some Professional SEO Help</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you haven&#8217;t realized it yet, it&#8217;s seemingly impossible to attain high volume of traffic without resorting to SEO. The SEO professionals know how to make your website more visible across the web, how to create relevant backlinks and at which places. Getting a good page rank for your site is extremely important, and that&#8217;s one area SEO professionals are able to address successfully. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Getting an appreciable number of organic visits a day is what dictates the success of your blog at the end of the day. When visits from Google start pouring in, you can be rest assured that your blog is one the right track to empowered traffic. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some of the keyword tools that can be used include:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Keyword Planner</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Word Tracker</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The keyword tools can help you know what are the keywords that get most searched by the audience of your industry. The meta tags and meta descriptions are arguable very important for any website to place its targeted keywords in a manner most reachable for the search engine crawlers. The meta descriptions can be up to 140 characters – so you have a fairly good scope of including the keywords into them. But what works bets is when you place the keywords at the very beginning of the description.</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>The Images of the Post</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The images in your post not only make them more readable by telling a story and moving it forward, but images make a great SEO tool as well. Do not let your image files&#8217; name sbe gibberish. When you name them appropriately, there is a greater chance of them cropping up in the Google image search results. Also, do fill out all the fields. There is a field, “Alternate text”. It will serve you well if you don&#8217;t leave it blank and write something in four to five words that describes the content.</span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Make Sure the Keyword Density is Just Right</b></span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you are sure of the keywords you are including are relevant and will do their bit in bringing in the traffic, the next thing you need to be sure of how densely you spread them across the content. Experts say it should not exceed more than 2%, since Google might penalize you for forcing the keywords into the content. And when you are including keywords in any post, make it certain that those are visible within the first two lines of the post.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Banality may more often than not find a room in business blogs since they are presenting information about an industry that already has voluminous literature dedicated to it. But giving your writeups a spin that is unique – both in terms of technical bits and the language – is what helps you stand out from the herd. </span></p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><em>This is a guest contribution by Greg Whelan of <a href="https://www.rankexperts.com/" target="_blank">RankExperts</a>.</em></p>
<h2 class="p1"><b>5. Relying on Backlinks Alone</b></h2>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The use of SEO has been on the rise for a long time, especially for people who venture in online business. However, while SEO is considered a core tool in enhancing online businesses, the same trend can trigger adverse effects if not implemented in the right way. There are certain limits that you must observe when employing SEO for your business &#8211; in other words, SEO for business should never be used blindly.</p>
<p>A great number of online businesses are established each day with most of them turning futile while others respond slowly. Note that some of these businesses make use of SEO strategies and still end up disappointing the founders. This implies that SEO should be used in a strategic and wise manner. It is the only way you will be in a position to make your business yield high returns.</p>
<p>To ensure that SEO works ideally for your business, certain techniques must be avoided. There are strategies which have been confirmed to be really alarming for online businesses hence the need to understand and avoid them now and in the long run. Below is a crackdown on five key SEO strategies which must be avoided for best gains in your business:</p>
<p></span></p>
<h2 class="p1">1. Purchase of Links</h2>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This happens to be one of the most profound habits among people who venture in online business. The good thing is that the trend has worked perfectly for most people in the past. However, the benefits attached to purchasing of links may be cut short in the long run.</p>
<p>It has been revealed that search engines are in the move to eradicate the trend of using purchased links in websites. Google for instance is working tooth and nail to ensure that the trend is stopped completely. It will surprise you to know that Google and other search engine companies have a great team of workers whose sole obligation is to trace purchased links and flag them. This implies that people who are used to buying links for their websites may get hurt in the near future after the fight against the link purchase is fully implemented.</p>
<p>At times, even the untrained eye can detect purchased links in any content. Some patterns formed by a set of links may not make sense at all hence they create suspicion. In addition, you might come across a set of unrelated links which do not even tally with the content in question. This is a pretty clear indication that the links are purchased. The bottom line is that search engine teams will easily know if you have used purchased links or not.</p>
<p></span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><b>2. Focus on Quantity of Links Rather Than Quality</b></h2>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While use of a huge number of backlinks is considered a perfect SEO strategy, the same can go a long way in ruining your online business. One of the worst mistakes that people make is placing their focus on incorporating a bunch of links in their websites not knowing that quality overrules quantity.</p>
<p>Link building is pretty simple since most people consider it so. Actually, it might not take you long to have a lot of links built for your site. However, most people fail to consider the quality of links they get. Instead, they get excited with the number and forget the quality.</p>
<p>Any link created should be authoritative and attractive to ensure that surfers follow it without a second thought. It is always advised that you refrain from links which are characterized by low DA. This is one of the core recipes behind failure in online business.<br />
</span></p>
<p class="p2">
<h2 class="p1"><b>3. Keyword Stuffing</b></h2>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For a long time, the threat behind keyword stuffing has been emphasized. It has been confirmed that use of many keywords in website content may trigger adverse effects to your business in terms of ranking. The sad part of it is that most people tend not to drop the practice of stuffing keywords in their content.</p>
<p>Keyword stuffing might have been working perfectly in the past couple of years but it no longer does these days. If you must elevate your business with the help of keywords, then optimization is paramount. You must focus on reaching the recommended density of keywords in your content and avoid stretching further. In most cases, keywords are expected to hit 2% density and nothing more.</p>
<p>Instead of using a lot of keywords in your website, it will work best if you focused on creating quality content. If keywords must be used, the appropriate application and fitting is necessary. The keywords must also be in context to ensure natural flow.</p>
<p></span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><b>4. Use of Duplicate Content</b></h2>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This is one of the most dangerous SEO strategies that any online businessperson can implement. In most cases, businesses with more than one site tend to recycle their content. You might come across similar articles in different sites. It is also possible to follow a certain link and find similar content from that of the mother website.</p>
<p>If you have the tendency of implementing duplicate content, then your online business is possibly not doing so well. It is important to note that search engines are always on the lookout for unoriginal content, regardless of whether or not the site is owned by one person. Normally, search engines do not rank two copies of similar content. In fact, a penalty may result from using duplicate content. This means that the mission of elevating your online business won&#8217;t work.<br />
</span><span class="s2"><b><br />
</b></span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><b>5. Relying on Backlinks Alone</b></h2>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you have the perception that use of backlinks is the only avenue towards achieving best ranking, then that is not so at all. There are other tools that must be employed to ensure best SEO for your business website. A lot of people have the delusion that many links in a website will remarkably boost traffic which in return elevates the ranking in search engines.</p>
<p>On the contrary, you must team up a number of SEO strategies and techniques for great results to be achieved. Depending on back-links alone will only boost SEO to some extent but not completely. You must ensure that the use of backlinks is balanced with other suites in the SEO sphere. Content marketing, use of social media, as well as onsite optimization can work as a perfect SEO blend.</p>
<p>The five strategies highlighted above are actually things that can be easily snubbed yet with very drastic and adverse effects in the end. They techniques must therefore be avoided at all costs since it is the only way you can move your business to a better level.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em><a href="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/HOW-TO-CREATE-MASSIVE-VALUE-CONTENT.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30989" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/HOW-TO-CREATE-MASSIVE-VALUE-CONTENT.jpg" alt="HOW TO CREATE MASSIVE VALUE CONTENT" width="600" height="222" /></a></em></span></p>
<p><em>This is a guest contribution from Pooja Lohana.</em></p>
<p>Let’s face it. Your readers are selfish.</p>
<p>The moment they land on your blog, they look for “what’s in it for me?”.</p>
<p>And that’s not such a bad thing after all.</p>
<p>Knowledge is power. Once you know what they are looking for, you can serve it to them.</p>
<p>At the time of writing this, there are 152,000,000 blogs on the Net. That means every <a href="http://www.wpvirtuoso.com/how-many-blogs-are-on-the-internet/">half</a> a second, a new blog is created somewhere in the world.</p>
<p>It’s getting harder and harder to be found in the blogosphere and this is not changing in the future.</p>
<p>If you’re passionate about your topic, perhaps you won’t mind blogging without traffic. But eventually, you will end it all in frustration.</p>
<p>You want people to share your message and to have great conversations with.</p>
<p>You want to stand for <em>something</em>.</p>
<p>The only way out is to stand out by writing unforgettable content or as I like to call <strong>Massive Value Content.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>What is Massive Value Content?</strong></h2>
<p>Jon Morrow calls it an “epic” post and prefers writing one epic post week rather than writing one mediocre post <em>every day</em>.</p>
<p>It solves you readers’ specific, burning problem.</p>
<p>You become a mind-reader. They relate with your post, thank you and leave tons of comments.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>39 Great Ideas to Beat the Dreaded Writer’s Block</em></li>
<li><em>102 Quick Recipes to Prepare Your Meals Under $10</em></li>
<li><em>The Ultimate Guide to Building a Business from $500</em></li>
<li><em>The Reason Blogging is Dead &amp; What to Do Instead</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Get the gist? Good.</p>
<p>When done right, it has good chances of going viral and bring you new eye balls.</p>
<p>Your blog gets back-linked, a <em>lot</em>. Influencers in your niche love to talk about you. Other bloggers invite you over for guest posts and webinars.</p>
<p>Perfect, isn’t it?</p>
<p>There is only one question: <em>How</em>.</p>
<p>I am not going to leave you high and dry or ask you to “go create epic sh*t”. I’m actually going to tell you how to do it and get noticed big time.</p>
<h2><strong>The Ultimate Cheatsheet to Create Massive Value Content on Your Blog</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>STEP 1. Keep Calm &amp; Create a Plan</strong></h3>
<p>Ever get a killer idea for a post in the shower? It hits you like a brick, and you cannot wait to run to your desk to complete your post.</p>
<p>You sit down, compose a cool post, add a stellar image and boom – you hit Publish.</p>
<p>And you wait for the comments to pour in. For a long time.</p>
<p>Slowly you realize that your “killer” post is actually a dud.</p>
<p>I’ve had that experience in the past. It still happens when I don’t pay attention to what I’m <em>creating</em>.</p>
<p>In fact, I’ve set a timer for 60 minutes in the past to write, format, and publish a post with a featured image.</p>
<p>The result? Only a handful of readers.</p>
<p>What’s missing is a concrete plan to stick to. I love how Jon stresses the importance of having a calendar. That was, all you have to do is “blindly” follow it!</p>
<p>Your editorial calendar is one of the simplest and most effective productivity tools out there. It’s a roadmap.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of a calendar for your blog:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="120"><strong>DATE</strong></td>
<td width="260"><strong>TYPE</strong></td>
<td width="102"><strong>TITLE</strong></td>
<td width="157"><strong>STATUS</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="120">June 02</td>
<td width="260">Massive Value Content (MVC)</td>
<td width="102">Tentative title</td>
<td width="157">Published/Pending/WIP</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="120">June 09</td>
<td width="260">Regular posts/Podcasts/Interview/Opinion/Video posts</td>
<td width="102">Tentative title</td>
<td width="157">Published/Pending/WIP</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="120">June 16</td>
<td width="260">MVC</td>
<td width="102">Tentative title</td>
<td width="157">Published/Pending/WIP</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="120">June 23</td>
<td width="260">Regular posts/Podcasts/Interview/Opinion/Video posts</td>
<td width="102">Tentative title</td>
<td width="157">Published/Pending/WIP</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="120">June 30</td>
<td width="260">MVC</td>
<td width="102">Tentative title</td>
<td width="157">Published/Pending/WIP</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Give yourself at least 7-8 hours to churn out each MVC post because you will need time for research and writing.</p>
<p>Then there’s external linking, sourcing images, social media so that that into account.</p>
<p>You can alternate MVCs with “regular posts” that can be shorter, quicker and easier to create. The frequency of both these posts and how you schedule them is totally up to you, but as a thumb rule, for every 3 regular posts, write at least one MVC post.</p>
<p>Now I know what you’re thinking – that looks like a <em>lot</em> of work in a month.</p>
<p>And I’m not going to lie to you. It is a lot of work.</p>
<p>If you rush a blog post, you will see mediocre results. The best advice if you’re serious about it is to be patient and focused.</p>
<h3><strong>STEP 2. Pick Your Type</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>1. Long Lists Post</strong></h4>
<p>People are lazy. Top it with the millions of results available at our finger tips from Google and you ought to love a shortcut.</p>
<p>A lists post gives your readers just that. It makes a specific promise and delivers.</p>
<p>How can you ever get a list post title wrong? Only when your content is not high-value.</p>
<p>If you are giving great value upfront, this type of post can never go wrong.</p>
<p>Don’t believe me? Take a look at the right hand sidebar of BBT. You’ll find it is full of list posts.</p>
<p>Why? Because list posts build authority. They are easy to relate with and promise juicy benefits to your readers upfront.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips to make your list posts even more effective:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Steer clear of fluff</strong>. Deliver value straight to the point. You can do this by staying focused on creating a list of steps that are fresh, effective and in-depth.<br />
Tell them <em>how.</em> For example, in this post I’m not just saying “write massive value content” but I’m also sharing how.</li>
<li><strong>Add references</strong>. Just because you’re creating a long list post doesn’t mean you have to cover everything. Link to external sources where necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Write more than 7 items for more eye-balls</strong>. One internal test done by HubSpot proved that list posts with less than 6 items weren’t as popular as their longer counterparts.</li>
<li><strong>Know when it’s not a list post</strong>. Don’t try to convert every single piece of content into a list-based post. Some are better off a tutorials or “ultimate guides”. A good example is when the list is less than 6 items.</li>
<li><strong>Use odd numbers when possible</strong>. According to a <a href="http://www.magnapubs.com/blog/teaching-and-learning/brain-based-online-learning-design/">study</a> conducted on students, odd numbered grouping worked better than even-numbered one.<br />
I wouldn’t take this too seriously though and I encourage you to come up with your own findings.<br />
And if you have 12 unique bullet points to share after multiple re-reads, by all means go ahead and share them!</li>
<li><strong>Use fine adjectives</strong>. Strategic adjectives work like a charm.<br />
Think “29 <em>Killer</em> Exercise Rituals”, “53 <em>Magnetic</em> Headlines” or “10 <em>Easy</em> Recipes Under $10”.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>2. Case Studies</strong></h4>
<p>If you have clients, you can use case studies and use it for dual purposes.</p>
<p>One, you’re creating MVC because case studies are much in-depth piece of information.</p>
<p>Two, you’re promoting your clients along the way.</p>
<p>KISSmetrics blog does this very well. They are known for rich case studies that solve a problem or deliver value.</p>
<p>Here’s <a href="http://blog.kissmetrics.com/industry-wide-gender-bias/">one</a> that explores industry-wide gender bias by WordStream.</p>
<p>A case study focuses on a specific example (WordStream in the above example) or a company as opposed to a white paper, which is more generic.</p>
<p>Using a case study boosts your credibility manifold. It shows your readers what’s possible and all they have to do is follow the exact steps you’ve listed.</p>
<p>Again, the magic of telling them how to do something, instead of telling them the what, is at work.</p>
<h4><strong>3. Tutorials &amp; Guides</strong></h4>
<p>Ever seen an “Ultimate Guide”?</p>
<p>Perhaps the most common ones have to do with social media or marketing.</p>
<p>“The Ultimate Guide to Using Pinterest” or “The Ultimate Guide to Successful Email Marketing”.</p>
<p>A quick search for “ultimate guide” on Google returns 439 Million results on my end. Refine the search for your industry or niche to get more specific.</p>
<p>For example, “ultimate guide blogging” returns more than 2 Million results.</p>
<p>This type of MVC is a full-blown tutorial on the topic, complete with screenshots, infographics, real life examples, steps, external reference links and calls-to-action. Anything that adds value goes.</p>
<p>In short, as a classic MVC, your ultimate guide will detail step-by-step instructions on how to do something.</p>
<p>Here’s another tip: Since these posts tend to be long, sprinkle visual elements in the form of infographics, video and memes to keep your readers engaged.</p>
<p><a href="http://socialmediachimps.com/infographics/why-infographics-data-visualization-works/">83%</a> of learning happens visually. Contrast this with people remembering only 20% of what they read every time so a visual guide along with supporting text works great.</p>
<p>You can always create infographics and other visually engaging content to support your articles with online apps such as Visme.</p>
<p>No matter what niche you’re in, you can still make use of an ultimate guide and do a few things with it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Give it away to your subscribers as a PDF in exchange for their email address. (Also known as lead magnet.)</li>
<li>Split it into a series of articles and send it to your mailing list in the form of an e-course.</li>
<li>Publish it on Kindle platform (You can list it as free or paid).</li>
<li>Record it in your own voice and sell it as an audio.</li>
<li>Create a course on Udemy and give it away.</li>
<li>Hold a webinar on the same content and give the guide away to listeners after the webinar.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>4. Collaborated Posts</strong></h4>
<p>Want to tap into other people’s audience for free?</p>
<p>You can. Except for the “free” part.</p>
<p>You see, there is no free lunch, so you have to put in some planning and effort in the mix before you can leverage an influencer’s reach.</p>
<ol>
<li>The first step is to create a list of influencers in your niche.</li>
<li>Then split the list into tiers 1, 2 and 3 according to their popularity. The bloggers with a slightly larger email list or reach that yours will go under “1”; a more popular one will occupy “2” and so on.</li>
<li>Start with the low-lying fruit, tier 1. (Although not absolutely necessary, you start here because that way you will be more confident when approaching more authoritative blogs.)</li>
<li>Build a relationship with these <em>people</em>.</li>
<li>When the time’s right, pick their brains on one <em>specific</em> question relevant to your blog post and bring all answers together for your next MVC.</li>
<li>When the post’s live, send the contributors a link and <em>thank</em> them. Let them know you’d appreciate if they can tweet or post about it.</li>
<li>Once you’ve worked with tier 1, it’s time to reach out to tier 2.</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>5. Curated Posts</strong></h4>
<p>Do you know why authorities like Oprah are famous? Because they know well to curate.</p>
<p>Curators are people who bring the best stuff at one place – in your case, that “place” is your blog.</p>
<p>Think about it – if your readers can get the best of all worlds, all well-organized, structured and ready to be served, wouldn’t the love you for it?</p>
<p>Curated posts, such as round-ups from the Net or resource pages listing out the best content <em>others</em> have spent hours creating, scream “authority”.</p>
<p>Here’s one: <a href="http://boostblogtraffic.com/blogging-tools/">63 Blogging Tools that Will Make You Insanely Productive</a>.</p>
<p>Do you see how it’s got 171 comments? Also, it’s one of the most popular blog posts BBT’s hosted as you can see in the right-hand sidebar.</p>
<p>It’s actually a resource post listing <em>everything</em> you need for your blog to be up and running (and making money too).</p>
<h4><strong>6. “Start Here” Page</strong></h4>
<p>Although this is technically a page, you can still count it as MVC because of its nature.</p>
<p>Think of it as a mini-about me page. Your visitors may be finding you from literally anywhere &#8212; Facebook, Twitter or another website.</p>
<p>When they land on your page, they need to be held by the hand and shown around.</p>
<p>The Start Here page will do just that and your visitors will thank you for it.</p>
<p>Most of all, this page gives you a chance to gain familiarity and likeability from visitors.</p>
<p>The purpose of a Start Here page is twofold:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tell them why your blog exists (the benefit)</li>
<li>Spoon-feed them your best content.</li>
</ol>
<p>So it’s a good idea to organize everything into categories and make it easy to check things out.</p>
<p>And while they’re here, why not ask their email in exchange for a juicy lead magnet (a free report, an audio clip etc)?</p>
<p>In a pistachio shell, here are some things to consider putting on your Start Here page:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why your blog exists</li>
<li>What’s in it for them</li>
<li>How can they access your content nicely tucked in one place</li>
<li>A welcome message with your photo</li>
<li>A video of you (optional)</li>
<li>Your vision, mission and values (don’t make it boring)</li>
<li>What you promise to offer</li>
<li>A reminder to join your mailing list</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>STEP 3. Do It Already!</strong></h3>
<p>It’s time to start creating Massive Value Content and claim your authority as a blogger.</p>
<p>Whatever your goal from blogging, the above steps will get you noticed, talked about and attract tons of eye-balls if you combine it with strategies like guest-posting and social media.</p>
<p><em>Every</em> serious blogger wants to know when they will hit “the jackpot”.</p>
<p><em>The first 1,000 subscribers.</em></p>
<p><em>The first time when they hit 5,000 visitors a day.</em></p>
<p><em>The first mention by NYT.</em></p>
<p><em>The first $10,000 month from blogging.</em></p>
<p>What they should be asking instead is how to become a better writer and generate unforgettable content.</p>
<p>In the words of Brian Clark, here’s how:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write.</li>
<li>Write more.</li>
<li>Write even more.</li>
<li>Write even more than that.</li>
<li>Write when you don’t want to.</li>
<li>Write when you do.</li>
<li>Write when you have something to say.</li>
<li>Write when you don’t.</li>
<li>Write every day.</li>
<li>Keep writing.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What exactly are you waiting for? Go create that piece of awesome content and make someone&#8217;s day!</strong></p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><em>This is a guest contribution from <a href="http://www.pratikdholakiya.com/">Pratik Dholakiya</a>.</em></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s Wednesday morning, you barely slept last night, missed your morning coffee because you were running late, and are now sat in front of your computer staring at a blank Word file wondering what on earth you’re going to write about. You know you should get on with the task but your hands don’t move and your brain refuses to boot up. You’re longing for Saturday already, but it’s only the middle of the week. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yeah, the world is a cruel place.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Especially for writers who need to hammer out reams of authentic material every single day of the week. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The good news, however, is there are ways around even the worst of the situations. I should know, I write for a living. I must have written thousands of articles so far, many of which were produced on days I was struggling.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Along the way I have devised quite a few mind hacks to tackle the problem of focus and motivation. One of these always bails me out on the days focus is a scarce commodity.</span></p>
<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Do Some Dumb Stuff</b></span></h2>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Well, you’re feeling dumb already, so this shouldn’t be a toughie!</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Dumb isn’t always bad, especially if it’s the humorous kind of dumb. Humor is good. It cracks you up, brings you back into the moment, lightens the mood, and suddenly the morning doesn’t feel so bad anymore. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When you loosen up and connect to the moment, ideas aren’t so hard to come by. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The best part about this is that it helps you think out of the box.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So you have to write about synthetic carpets and you are bored as hell at the mere thought of it?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Your best bet is to let your imagination run wild. Think of everything one can do on carpets. Imagine a huge carpet flying up in the sky with Calvin and Hobbes sitting on it.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">That’s your idea – best cartoon strips featuring carpets. </span></p>
<p class="p2">
<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Listen to Chants or Any Music That Helps You Focus</b></span></h2>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsKjj41ormI" target="_blank">Here’s</a> one brilliant suggestion, which really melts the distractions for me. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Create a playlist for all moods. If you choose the right kind of music, you may find it easier to get your mind on the task.</span></p>
<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Put on Earplugs</b></span></h2>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">No, really. The kind that go in deep and drown out your surroundings. You will be surprised at how beautifully they work. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This is a tried and tested measure which goes back to my university days. Any time I feel scatter-brained and unable to focus, I get out my earplugs (have gotten into the habit of carrying them with me). It’s eerily quiet when your ears are plugged. You don’t go deaf, but all noise loses its edge. Even the sound of your colleague on steroids jabbing away at his keyboard feels like it’s streaming in from somewhere far away. You can hear yourself breathing. You can also listen to your thoughts and follow them without any effort. The writing that this frame of mind produces, regardless of whether you have slept the night before or not, is surprisingly sharp.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I don’t exactly know why this works, but here’s my guess – shutting down one of the senses makes the rest perform even better. With earplugs on, the noise around you does not register, which means you automatically listen to yourself loud and clear. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Unless you have tried this you will never guess just how much of our energy leaks to sounds and noisy distractions, even in seemingly quiet places. On days you are not feeling bright, this neat trick could make all the difference.</span></p>
<p class="p4">
<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Watch a Stimulating TED Talk</b></span></h2>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One can feel distracted and foolish for a number of reasons. Sometimes it may have to do more with a lack of creativity than with your energy levels. If your enthusiasm for life is wavering or you need a dose of inspiration to fire up, a <a href="http://www.ted.com/"><span class="s2">good TED talk</span></a> may work better than coffee. For someone I know, watching old Seinfeld videos does the trick. It’s up to you to figure out what inspires you and refer to it when the need arises.</span></p>
<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Create a Bank of Go-to Blogs </b></span></h2>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Reading some brilliant writing (especially that which is full of play on words) gets me in the mood each time. My phone is loaded with apps that bring to me the choicest of writing from a variety of sources. You can create your own database of inspirational blogs (not necessarily the most popular blogs) and watch the magic rub off on you.</span></p>
<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Pick Topics That You Can Write on in First Person</b></span></h2>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you have the choice to pick your subjects, pick up the ones that present a greater scope for personalization.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s always easier to write something based on your experience, or even narrate a fictional episode, if you already love writing. That kind of stuff just flows because it comes from your heart, not your mind (which you don’t think is working), and before you realize it you have already put a few hundred words on the doc file.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Leave the research-heavy stuff for days you have slept well and are actually having a bearable morning.</span></p>
<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Lay out a Structure for Your Posts</b></span></h2>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you don’t have the luxury to choose your topics, and calling in sick is not an option, use your limited energy wisely.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Spend some of it in creating a solid structure for your post, something you can rely on to guide you through till the end. </span></p>
<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Let Things Come to You</b></span></h2>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Trying too hard is a recipe for failure. It’s worse on the days you are already suffering. Let go of laboring over ideas. Instead, take a 5-minute break to collect your thoughts. Just wait patiently, with a calm mind, no hurry at all. The ideas will come to you, and sooner than if you were to chase them. (If you make meditation a part of your life, it will prove priceless during such times.)</span></p>
<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Get Moving</b></span></h2>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When the mind is stuck, moving your body can make it come unstuck. Go on a short walk and walk with a spring in your step. Tap dance in the bathroom for a couple of minutes. The mind-body connection is deep, and the rhythm of one rubs off on the other.</span></p>
<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Create a Mind Map</b></span></h2>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Images come to rescue when words fail us. Take out a pen and paper, or your smartphone, and start drawing. For something related to home décor, draw a home, then a garden, the windows, and the like. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Alternatively, <a href="http://lifehacker.com/how-to-use-mind-maps-to-unleash-your-brains-creativity-1348869811"><span class="s2">create a mind map</span></a> with a pen or a stylus in your hand; I find this works better than doing so on the computer. Both these methods will very likely give you a few breakthroughs, which will make your assignment easier for you.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Finally, <b>get a perspective</b>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If nothing works, it’s all right. You are allowed to have a bad day.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="color: #222222;">Who are you?</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="color: #222222;">Don’t fret &#8211; this isn’t philosophy class and no, we’re not trying to steal your identity.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">One of the most important things you can do in 2014 as a content creator, is identify<strong> who you are as a personal brand</strong> by monitoring how you come across online. As a writer, it is essential that you are taking advantage of every opportunity you have to turn yourself into a developed brand. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="color: #222222;"><span style="color: #000000;">Twitter, that always-on social network that is constantly abuzz, and Google+, a social network claimed to offer incredible SEO benefits, offer two incredible ways that complement each other to solidify your digital presence. But how, you ask? </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="color: #222222;"><span style="color: #000000;">Through digital authorship.</span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">Introducing Your New Best Friend: Google Authorship</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="color: #222222;"><span style="color: #000000;">Everyone is talking Authorship, and with good reason. Google Authorship is a revolutionary function of Google that allows you to identify content you’ve produced, as well as the publishers you’ve produced content for.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="color: #222222;"><span style="color: #000000;">The purpose of Google Authorship is to help segment out true quality content from the plethora of content living on the web. Executive chairman of Google Eric Schmidt wrote in “The New Digital Age” that the true cost of remaining anonymous may be detrimental one’s overall search position:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" style="color: #222222;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Within search results, information tied to verified online profiles will be ranked higher than content without such verification, which will result in the in most users naturally clicking on the top (verified) results. The true cost of remaining anonymous, then, might be irrelevance.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" style="color: #222222;"><span style="color: #000000;">Google Authorship helps to further the notion that all content is not good content; rather, writers must have a) verified content and b) a solidified niche subject matter that they consistently produce original content about. Google Authorship helps to bridge the gap between the casual writer, and the professional content creator.</span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">AuthorRank &#8211; Myth or Legend?</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="color: #222222;"><span style="color: #000000;">While AuthorRank is tough to concretely define, its origins can be traced back to 2005 (pre-historic in digital terms) and as Brian Clark puts it:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" style="color: #222222;">“Author Rank is the idea – supported by patents filed by Google – that who creates a page of content (and links out from that page), based on their historical reputation for creating content people actually like, would become one of the signals Google relies on when ranking relevant results of a particular topic.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #222222;">While AuthorRank hasn’t officially been implemented by Google as a ranking factor, the idea behind it has already been implemented across digital marketing platforms universally. How do we know? One such sign that has the digital world up in arms is the removable of the pictures next to bylines with Authorship correctly set-up. Some are foolishly associating this cosmetic tweak with the demise of Google Authorship &#8211; which couldn’t be farther than the truth. It actually represents the opposite! Google is continuing to acknowledge content produced with semantic markup as higher quality content than content without Authorship, pictures or not. Change isn’t always a bad thing.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">Even if AuthorRank never officially occurs, it really doesn’t matter in terms of SEO. Why? Because quality content will continue to reign supreme, and those with their authorship set up, who continuously produce content in their particular field will become obvious authorities. We don’t need AuthorRank to tell us that.   </span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">While Authorship may have lost that visual touch, this minor change was done in an effort to improve mobile search results. Your authorship markup still lives, even without a face, and still has a heavy role in distinguishing you as a credible author on the web, so take advantage.</span></p>
<div style="color: #222222;">
<h2 dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">Set Up Your Authorship</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">Setting up your authorship is relatively easy, and requires a few lines of code in the backend of your posts, as well as a link to the publication on your Google+ profile. Google provides a step-by-step guide to authenticating your authorship </span><a style="color: #1155cc;" href="https://plus.google.com/authorship" target="_blank">here</a><span style="color: #000000;"> and as outlined below:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">You can link content you publish on a specific domain to </span><a style="color: #1155cc;" href="https://plus.google.com/me" target="_blank">your Google+ profile</a><span style="color: #000000;">.</span></p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr" style="color: #000000;">
<p dir="ltr">Make sure you have a profile photo with a recognizable headshot.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="color: #000000;">
<p dir="ltr">Make sure a byline containing your name appears on each page of your content</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="color: #000000;">
<p dir="ltr">Make sure your byline name matches the name on your Google+ profile.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="color: #000000;">
<p dir="ltr">Verify you have an email address on the same domain as your content. (Don&#8217;t have an email address on the same domain? <a style="color: #1155cc;" href="http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=1408986&amp;expand=option2" target="_blank">Use this method to link your content to your Google+ profile</a>)</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="color: #000000;">
<p dir="ltr">Submitting this form will add your email address to the <a style="color: #1155cc;" href="https://plus.google.com/me/about/edit/wo" target="_blank">Work section of your profile</a>, which by default is viewable only by your circles. You can keep your email private if you wish. It will also add a public link to the domain of the email address to the <a style="color: #1155cc;" href="https://plus.google.com/me/about/edit/co" target="_blank">Contributor to section of your profile</a>.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="color: #000000;">
<p dir="ltr">Sign up for Authorship.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">Cross-Checking Your Google Authorship Code</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">Once you have your authorship set up, you’ll want to ensure: </span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="color: #000000;">
<p dir="ltr">Your content has true semantic Google authorship &lt;a href=”<a style="color: #1155cc;" href="https://plus.google.com/G+ID" target="_blank">https://plus.google.com/<wbr />G+ID</a>? rel=author”&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="color: #000000;">
<p dir="ltr">Your content’s  @href contains a G+ profile link and @rel=”author” or @rel=”me”</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="color: #000000;">
<p dir="ltr">Your content’s @href contains a G+ profile link with the [?&amp;]rel=author query parameter and @rel DOES NOT contain nofollow.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="color: #000000;">
<p dir="ltr">Your readable author bio pages inlcude&lt;a href=”[profile_url]?rel=<wbr />author”&gt;Joe Smith&lt;/a&gt;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">While you’ve likely heard more than enough about how to optimize your Google+ profile, have you given any consideration to your Twitter account for personal branding and authorship success? If not, you should.</span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">Twitter for Authorship? YES!</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">In the same way that Google+ and authorship serve as an indicator of your online brand, Twitter works as a constant source of credibility via conversations.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Appearance: </span><span style="color: #000000;">Twitter recently unveiled a new design that is big on content and visuals. Much like the Facebook design, the new Twitter profile boosts a larger header image and profile photo. In order to have a uniform appearance across the Internet, make sure you choose a profile photo that displays your face clearly, looks professional, and is used across your various personal social properties.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">The new Twitter layout also highlights your tweets that get the most engagement, which brings me to our next point&#8230;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Verbiage:</span><span style="color: #000000;">First, create a Twitter bio that is filled with your subject matter expertise &#8212; and hashtag them to create added virality in your profile. Next, add your website, LinkedIn profile, personal blog, and tag any publications that you frequently contribute to.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">Beyond the content you post, your website is the only direct lead-generation tool that exists on Twitter profiles. Leave that field blank, and those viewing your page will not have an easy way to learn more about you and your content.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">Another great new feature is the ability to pin tweets to the top of your page. Choose a pin that not only received a good amount of engagement, but that personifies you as a brand. Keep it fresh by switching up your pinned tweets every few days!</span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">Sharing is Caring</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">Who you follow is almost as important as what you post. Find people that are influential to your particular field, as well as publications or companies that you admire, to follow. Engage with the people you follow by commenting and retweeting, in addition to posting relevant, new information. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">Convince and Convert </span><a style="color: #1155cc;" href="http://www.convinceandconvert.com/social-media-measurement/new-research-finds-the-curation-vs-creation-sweet-spot/" target="_blank">suggests that the sweet spot of curation</a><span style="color: #000000;"> (non self-promotional) vs. self-promotional linking to your site 25-50% of the time generates the best results. Always socialize the content you produce, but make sure to include a healthy mix of re-Tweets of informative, inspiring, and relevant content.</span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">Metadata on Twitter</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">Twitter Cards enable you to attach media to Tweets that link your content: It’s social’s all-important metadata. Whether that be a summary, a summary with a photo, gallery card, app card, player card, a product card, lead generation card, or website card &#8211; Twitter cards enhance the appearance of your Tweets and add to your overall prominence on social.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">To set up your Twitter card, add a few lines of HTML to the backend of your site, and voila! Popular content management systems like Hubspot and WordPress offer social plugins, making this step even easier.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">Users who share your content will have a “card” automatically added to said Tweet, that will be visible to all of their followers.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">Twitter offers more information on how to set up your very own Twitter card </span><a style="color: #1155cc;" href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards" target="_blank"><span style="color: #000000;">here</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">:</span></p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr" style="color: #000000;">
<p dir="ltr">Review the <a style="color: #1155cc;" href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards" target="_blank">documentation</a> for the type of card you want to implement.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="color: #000000;">
<p dir="ltr">Add the pertinent <a style="color: #1155cc;" href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/markup-reference" target="_blank">meta tags</a> to your page.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="color: #000000;">
<p dir="ltr">Run your URLs against the <a style="color: #1155cc;" href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/validation/validator" target="_blank">validator tool</a> to be approved.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="color: #000000;">
<p dir="ltr">After approval, tweet the URL and see the Card appear below your tweet.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="color: #000000;">
<p dir="ltr">Use <a style="color: #1155cc;" href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/analytics" target="_blank">Twitter Card analytics</a> to measure your results.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">Content Attribution</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">Lastly, you’ll want to look for the following metadata on each piece of content you produce to make sure it’s properly attributed to you:</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="color: #000000;">
<p dir="ltr">Authorship is valid if: meta[@name='twitter:creator'] tag (@content is a valid twitter handle [0-9A-Za-z_]{1,15}).</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="color: #000000;">
<p dir="ltr">Authorship is valid if: &lt;a&gt; tag @href is a Twitter profile URL and @rel is “author” or @rel is “me”.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="color: #000000;">
<p dir="ltr">Your readable author bio page on Twitter includes an on-site rel=”author” link in your author bio.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">Why Social Optimization Matters for Writers</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">So, why am I yelling at you about everything from your philosophical identity to coding? Well, because, as a writer, this stuff matters.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">Establishing credibility as a content curator in an aggressively digital age is tough, and while you may have your authorship and Twitter perfectly optimized, there is no sure-fire way to know that you are an influential writer to your particular niche… Or, is there?</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">Recently launched, </span><a style="color: #1155cc;" href="http://www.clearvoice.com/" target="_blank">ClearVoice</a><span style="color: #000000;"> is a new metric for your voice. It acts as a representative of your content’s authority and showcases your publication’s power. By using a first-of-its-kind algorithm, Clearvoice generates a score for writers based on:</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="color: #000000;">
<p dir="ltr">Your Twitter and Google authorship markup</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="color: #000000;">
<p dir="ltr">Where your content lives</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="color: #000000;">
<p dir="ltr">How many articles you’ve published</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="color: #000000;">
<p dir="ltr">How many domains you’ve contributed to</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="color: #000000;">
<p dir="ltr">The social virality of your content</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Beyond the funky look and ease of use, ClearVoice offers the ability for writers to claim their profile. Once claimed, writers will have a unique URL that will act as a constantly updating portfolio, chronicling not only all the content you’ve produced, but how well it performed socially. In addition, authors can <a style="color: #1155cc;" href="http://alpha.clearvoice.com/tips-and-tricks/" target="_blank">cross-check proper authorship implementation</a> and troubleshoot with engineers if there are any issues.</p>
<p dir="ltr">ClearVoice can also organically help you score jobs, as publishers can search the platform to discover writer’s who are qualified in a particular field.The ClearVoice score offers an unique view into individual writers influence, as well as offers an unprecedented way for writers to be discovered.</p>

<p class="p1"><a href="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/security_pic_header.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31518" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/security_pic_header.jpg" alt="security_pic_header" width="640" height="426" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>10 Vital WordPress Security Tips</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Security should be of paramount concern to any blogger or website owner. It may seem like a tedious task, but it could protect your website from becoming a hacker’s playground. If your site has a revenue stream, then some time invested into security could also protect your livelihood. This article overviews a few key security tips for WordPress blogs. There’s an ever growing collection of useful plugins, but it’s dangerous to think that there is a single solution to website security. It’s important to maintain an ongoing interest in security to provide a reliable defence against hackers.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>1. Secure Hosting</b></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">If you unknowingly opt for a provider which is infamous for its hosting vulnerabilities, you’ll be cursing your decision at a later date. Research is the key, so allocate some time to find a reputable company with a strong security strategy. Price is likely to be the main comparison point between providers, but sometimes paying slightly more can prove to be a sensible long-term decision. </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>2. Work on a Secure Network with a Clean PC</b></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">One of the joys of web-based software is ease of access. It might be seriously tempting to amend a blog post when you’re enjoying a coffee in your local café, but accessing WordPress on an unsecure network could seriously compromise your security. At home, where you probably have a more robust network, you should also be sure that your machine is free of malware, spyware and viruses. A sneaky key logger could undo all of your other security measures.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>3. Keep Updated</b></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Ensure that your themes, plugins and WordPress itself are all updated regularly. There are developers out there working to protect your site, so don’t miss out on crucial updates that patch the latest security vulnerabilities.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/wordpress_updates_pic1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-31515" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/wordpress_updates_pic1.jpg" alt="wordpress_updates_pic1" width="600" height="324" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>4. Strong Passwords</b></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Passwords consisting of mainly names and correctly spelt words are extremely susceptible to brute-force attacks. Use characters, randomly mix up your capitalisation and avoid names and words. If ‘petname1’ is memorable for you, why not use ‘P@naMe01!’ – it might seem silly, but having some kind of association in your mind will enable you to remember it. Alternatively there are software solutions that store and encrypt your passwords; <a href="http://www.roboform.com/"><span class="s3">Roboform</span></a> and <a href="https://lastpass.com/"><span class="s3">LastPass</span></a> are both great options.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>5. Enable Secure SSL Login Pages</b></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Logging into WordPress through an encrypted channel will provide another layer of protection. Be sure to check with your hosting provider to see if you have an SSL certificate, or are utilising Shared SSL. Then add this line of code to your wp-config.php file:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">define(’FORCE_SSL_ADMIN’, true);</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">If you want an easier option, then there is a plugin that allows SSL control of your site: <span class="s3"><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-https/%2520">WordPress HTTPS (SSL)</a></span></span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>6. Don’t Use ‘Admin’ as a Username</b></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">From version 3.0 onwards you have been able to update your WordPress username, so you’re no longer limited to using the default of ‘admin’. There have been widespread attacks in the past, which have exploited the fact that millions of users still have ‘admin’ as their username. The easiest way to do this is to create a new user account in WordPress and give it admin access, you can then simply delete the old account.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/wp_admin_pic2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31516" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/wp_admin_pic2.jpg" alt="wp_admin_pic2" width="329" height="339" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>7. Hide Your Login from the Author Archive</b></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">It’s possible to find out a WordPress user’s login, simply by viewing the author archive page’s permalink – i.e. <i>http://www.example.com/author/username/</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">However, it’s fairly straightforward to remove this. The simple solution is to use the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-author-slug/"><span class="s3">WP Author Slug</span></a> plugin. </span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>8. Limit Login Attempts</b></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Limiting the number of login attempts from a single IP address can thwart some hackers, especially if your site has been targeted by a brute-force attack. Thankfully there’s a handy plugin – <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/limit-login-attempts/"><span class="s3">Limit Login Attempts</span></a>.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>9. Disable File Editing</b></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">It can be really useful to edit your theme’s files within the dashboard. However, once you’re happy that you no longer need to edit these files, then it’s sensible to remove this functionality. This will prevent hackers from changing these files. All you need to do is access your wp-config.php file and add the following line of code:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">define( ‘DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT’, true );</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a href="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/wordpress_file_editing_pic3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31517" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/wordpress_file_editing_pic3.jpg" alt="wordpress_file_editing_pic3" width="140" height="261" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>10. Create Regular Backups</b></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">It’s a mundane task, and one that is often neglected. Backing up could potentially save your site from the website graveyard, it’s a vital step even if you’ve taken all the appropriate security measures. Thankfully, there’s a fantastic plugin that automates the task and removes the mundaneness &#8211; <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/backupwordpress/"><span class="s3">BackUpWordPress</span></a>. It’s a very popular plugin that’s famed amongst the WordPress community for its simplicity and ease of use.</span></p>
<h2 class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>Summary &amp; Other Security Plugins</b></span></h2>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">No single plugin will completely protect your site, therefore the above steps shouldn’t be ignored. It’s also important not to have plugins installed that you don’t use. Feel free to try out some of the plugins below, but if you’re not using them it’s best to uninstall them. Some of the multi-purpose plugins are fantastic, but they might aim to correct certain things you may have already fixed, so assess their features to decide if it’s worth installing.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3"><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/login-lockdown/">Login Lockdown</a></span><span class="s2"> – blocks IP addresses for a given time after repeated failed login attempts.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3"><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/lockdown-wp-admin/">Lockdown WP Admin</a></span><span class="s2"> &#8211; hides WordPress Admin (/wp-admin/) when a user isn&#8217;t logged in.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3"><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/sucuri-scanner/">Sucuri Security</a></span><span class="s2"> &#8211; checks your site for malware, spam, blacklisting and other security issues.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3"><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-security-scan/">Acunetix WP Security</a></span><span class="s2"> &#8211; checks your WordPress website/blog for security vulnerabilities and suggests corrective actions.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3"><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/better-wp-security/">iThemes Security</a></span><span class="s2"> – Formerly Better WP Security, this plugin offers over 30 ways to secure and protect your WordPress site. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><em>This is a guest contribution from Sonja Jobson.</em></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This might sound familiar: you’re staring at a blank screen, panic slowly rising, headache setting in, mind blank. You’re due to publish a blog post but you have absolutely no idea what to write about. <i>Again</i>.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The “writers block” cycle can put a serious cramp in your blogging style, but contrary to popular opinion, it’s not a mysterious ailment with no known cure. In most cases, writers block is a direct result of poor planning.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This is good news, because it means that with correct planning, you can skip right over the blank screen and save loads of time and sanity when blogging.</span></p>
<h2 class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>First Things First: Your Editorial Calendar</b></span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Before we dig into using content themes, you need to have some tools in place to hold the whole process together.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2009/04/17/editorial-calendar/"><span class="s2">editorial calendar</span></a> is like a blogging secret weapon – except, it’s not so secret. Most successful blogs – across all sorts of niches and industries – use editorial calendars to give structure and consistency to their blogging.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If you’re not already on the editorial calendar bandwagon, now’s the time to jump on. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If you’ve been putting off starting an editorial calendar because it sounds too time consuming, complicated, or technical, don’t worry about it. Starting an editorial calendar can be as simple as grabbing a cheap wall calendar from the store and penciling in blog posts on the appropriate dates. Or, you could go digital and use an app like <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar"><span class="s2">Google Calendar</span></a> or start a simple spreadsheet.</span></p>
<h2 class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>What are Content Themes?</b></span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Coming up with an endless stream of fresh blog post ideas can be exhausting. But, like most tasks, it can be made simpler by building on your momentum instead of approaching it in a scattered, ununiformed way.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Say you get an intriguing question from a reader that sparks some inspiration, and you spend some time figuring out how to transform that idea into solid blog post. It takes a bit of time, but you finally find a good angle and the perfect way to tie the topic into your overall blog theme. Next week’s blog topic: check.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Now you go back to square one and begin coming up with an entirely new blog topic to add to your editorial calendar.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Starting the idea process at square one over and over again is time consuming. There is a simpler process that requires you to complete step one <i>just once</i>, and then build on that same foundation to create weeks or months’ worth of content ideas all at once.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">That’s where content themes come in: it allows you to pick a broad topic and build off of it with a bunch of hyper-focused topics, making the planning process quicker and more organized.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">For example, take a look at <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2014/03/30/creating-product-week-how-to-create-and-sell-products-on-your-blog/"><span class="s4">ProBlogger’s product creation theme week</span></a>. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> <a href="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-12-at-2.50.30-pm.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31512" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-12-at-2.50.30-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-08-12 at 2.50.30 pm" width="587" height="365" /></a></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For an entire week, each post focused on creating products, diving into sub-topics like <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2014/04/01/creating-products-week-before-you-even-think-about-creating-products-think-about-this/"><span class="s2">what to do before you create a product</span></a>, <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2014/04/02/creating-products-week-which-product-should-i-create/"><span class="s2">what type of product to create</span></a>, and <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2014/04/04/creating-products-week-the-launch-countdown/"><span class="s2">launching a product</span></a>.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>How to Create and Plan Content Themes</b></span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You can structure content themes in several different ways.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Some bloggers find that themes save them so much time and hassle that they use them on an ongoing basis for content planning (each theme beginning right after the other one ends).</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You can also use themes for a set period of time (say, one week or one month) scattered throughout your editorial calendar whenever you want to create a focused burst of content on a specific topic.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Regardless of whether you choose to use themes on an ongoing or selective basis, the steps for creating and planning your theme will be the same.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Step #1: choose your topic</b></span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You always build a theme on a base topic. For example, a health blog might create a theme based on the topic of ‘eating raw foods for weight loss’. Or, an entertainment blog might create a theme around the topic of ‘80’s movies that are still going strong’. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The two keys to coming up with theme topics are 1) choosing a topic that is broad enough to support several sub-topics (in other words, you shouldn’t be able to sum it up it just one blog post) and 2) the topic needs to be something your audience cares about.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Step #2: choose your timeframe</b></span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">After you know your topic, you’ll need to decide how long you want your theme to run. A week? A month? Several months? There is no hard and fast rule on how long a theme should run, so make the decision based on how much content you think you’ll need to create to cover the topic, or simply how long feel like talking about the same thing.</span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Step #3: Choose and schedule your sub-topics</b></span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Now that you know your main topic and the amount of blog post slots you want to fill, it’s time to sit down and plan your individual blog posts. Coming up with a calendar full of ideas should be much easier now that you have a base topic to work off of. A great way to get started is by asking yourself “what are the most pressing questions my audience has about this topic?”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As you decide on individual blog post topics, schedule them into your editorial calendar.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And that’s it! You now have an organized group of blog posts and, for the duration of your theme, you’ll never have to wonder “what should I write about?”</span></p>
<h2 class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Bonus: Use Your Blogging Themes to Simplify Your Other Marketing Outlets</b></span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Saving all that time when planning out your blog content was pretty good, but it gets even better.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You can use the themes you create for your blog to streamline all your other content marketing efforts as well.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Use your theme to help you come up with social media updates, live event (like webinars, live steams, or Q&amp;A sessions) topics, email marketing or newsletter content, or whatever types content you create to market your blog or business.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Using one theme across all of your online platforms will help you to create consistency, structure, and a lot more free time.</span></p>
