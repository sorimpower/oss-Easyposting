<p>In case you missed it, the ‘ruthless pragmatism’ approach to politics of House of Cards’ Frank Underwood has stretched far beyond Capitol Hill to the world of content marketing. With the lessons learned about the changing media landscape, Kevin Spacey, Underwood’s real-life actor alter-ego, is becoming influential in Marketing as well as Hollywood.</p>
<p>The success of House of Cards for Netflix is unlike any previous television show and has become a symbol of the online content movement. Since the show’s release, Mr. Spacey has spoken at several conferences <a href="http://debsylee.com/kevin-spacey-content-marketing/" target="_blank">urging journalists and broadcasters</a> to follow the Netflix model of producing in-depth content with a great story, yet­ he still surprised people by giving a keynote speech at the recent Content Marketing World conference in Cleveland.</p>
<p>At the largest Content Marketing conference in the world, he spoke to an audience of over 2,500 excited, B2B and B2C influencers and marketers. Mr. Spacey is a content marketer himself, you see. His place on the board of the freelancer website Scripted.com gives him a stake in the growth of the industry. All this together makes Spacey a true marketing influencer.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17396" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/CMW_Spacey_403-01-300x300.jpg" alt="Kevin Spacey" width="300" height="300" /></p>
<p>Spacey has given some great advice in his speeches lately. You might even use Frank Underwood’s ‘ruthless pragmatism’ analogy for a content marketer who follows these three content marketing lessons from Kevin Spacey and House of Cards:</p>
<h3>1. Tell your brand’s story with content, and take risks doing it</h3>
<p>Content marketing can be hard to sell to executives because its ROI takes a while to kick-in. Kevin Spacey’s CMWorld keynote was titled “It Has Always Been about the Story”, so you can guess his stance on the issue. Spacey has said that in pitching House of Cards, his team was planning on, “telling a story that takes a long time to tell”, and would not compromise to the traditional pilot-first TV model that truncates a show’s ability to prove its concept. It was a risk, but they were creating a story and knew they needed a serious investment to show the result they wanted.</p>
<p>Netflix made their bet that the story would be a good one and gave House of Cards a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/dorothypomerantz/2013/07/18/the-producer-behind-house-of-cards-on-how-netflix-offered-creative-freedom/" target="_blank">$100 Million budget</a> for two seasons. In 2012, “Netflix Original Content” was just launching so the success of House of Cards, while taking up most of their overall budget, gave their brand a reputation for going against the typical pilot model and the highest quality product possible. What they knew was that this <a href="http://www.thewire.com/technology/2013/02/economics-netflixs-100-million-new-show/61692/" target="_blank">investment</a> was worth it because they knew <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/02/01/how_netflix_is_turning_viewers_into_puppets/" target="_blank">their customer would want it</a>.</p>
<p>The investment has clearly paid off for both the Netflix and House of Cards brands. Is your brand story taking any risks? If not, the implications of that choice could be the difference between your product being a market-leader and being an also-ran, or even cancelled.</p>
<p>As Mr. Spacey quoted his character Underwood in his CMWorld speech,</p>
<blockquote>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;">“we’ve worked too hard and come within an arm’s reach of the prize, only to have our hands cut off just before we seize it. For those of us climbing to the top of the food chain, there is but one rule, hunt or be hunted.”</span></h3>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a ruthless pragmatism analogy for taking risks in content marketing, if there ever was one.</p>
<h3>2. Give the people what they want</h3>
<p>At CMWorld, Spacey spoke about the virtues of the “democratization of content” movement that has given power over the market to content consumers. By following this movement and constantly being a listener of your customer, you can give them what they already want. Like Netflix subscribers, Spacey believes content consumers should get, “what they want, when they want it, how they want it, and at a price they are willing to pay”. Netflix was built to prove this theory.</p>
<p>Before they signed on for House of Cards, they already knew their subscribers like Kevin Spacey and the show’s producer David Fincher (who previously produced the popular show, The Sopranos) so Netflix banked on even more customers joining in to watch the subscription-only show. Netflix’s user tracking data already showed that their customer did not simply want a single episode trial of a show and then one episode per week. Their customer wants to spend all weekend (or a single day) with the blinds closed, sitting on the couch, and eating pizza as they finish the whole 13 episode season at once.</p>
<p>While your business may not have that kind of product, you can work on creating binge-worthy content. A combination of marketing analytics and other resources can give your company the intelligence to learn what your customer wants, and inspiration to formulate a great piece of content to give to them when they want it. This process, when done correctly, will pay dividends in the long-run.</p>
<h3>3. Be the best answer for your customer</h3>
<p>While House of Cards is siloed in the Netflix online channel, the brand is heavily promoted and has been seen in several other forms, such as Jimmy Fallon has parodying the show and Underwood’s character being used in a Call of Duty videogame. When a Netflix subscriber is ready for their next binge-watching session, they have a subscription and can go back to Netflix for more content.</p>
<p>Netflix needs to be the best answer for on-demand content for their customers, as they are certainly not the only company in their expanding market. This can only work by following Spacey’s content advice mentioned above, “what they want, when they want it, how they want it, and at a price they are willing to pay”.</p>
<p>With your brand’s content, you can build upon a piece of “magnet content” that brought them in at first by having different channels for customers to encounter your products at the time they want it. There are a lot more than one silo to worry about for content marketers, so having a strategy for each is important to be the best answer when your customer is ready to ask.</p>
<p>Armed with these lessons, are you ready for the ‘ruthless pragmatism’ approach to content marketing? Kevin Spacey left the conference with this quote,</p>
<blockquote>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;">“Get your minds to work, express yourselves with confidence, and always remember, that it’s the risk takers that are rewarded”.</span></h3>
</blockquote>
<p>To see where you sit on the Frank Underwood scale of content marketing, evaluate the following questions with your team:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is your story good enough to binge on?</li>
<li>How can you use data to determine what your customer really wants?</li>
<li>Is your content finding your customer when they want to find it?</li>
</ul>
<p>Please use the comments to tell us your answers!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17393" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_144653342.jpg" alt="shutterstock_144653342" width="500" height="334" /></p>
<p>Increasing numbers of marketers are enthusiastic about the power of influencer marketing – and not just in the B2C marketing world. B2B marketers are also discovering that influencer marketing goes beyond things like asking bloggers to vouch for their products on Twitter in return for a free sample.</p>
<p>Professionals with clout are engaged in active digital conversations about things that matter to them with their audiences – audiences that contain buyers that are influenced about which products and services they buy. According to a study by Nielsen, 85% of consumers seek out trusted expert content when considering a purchase.</p>
<p>Aligned with these influencers, B2B brands can build relationships, speak to industry issues, and form mutually beneficial partnerships. As <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2014/07/influencer-marketing-content/">Lee wrote recently</a>, influencer marketing can be a faster way to build thought leadership than creating it from scratch. We&#8217;ve been implementing B2B influencer content programs for ourselves and clients for several years. The impact has been substantial, creating greater awareness, consideration and authority for the B2B brands involved. We&#8217;ve also learned the importance of gaining consensus about what an influencer marketing program can achieve.</p>
<p>Savvy B2B marketers know that changes in marketing strategy and tactics require some convincing and support in order to be successful. Before you go full steam ahead with something new like an influencer marketing program, it&#8217;s important to get buy-in from executives, your stakeholders, and anybody else whose support is needed with marketing strategy decisions.</p>
<p><strong>So how do you take a new B2B influencer marketing plan back to your constituents on Monday morning and get them as excited as you are?</strong></p>
<p>Even if you’re enthusiastic about how an influencer marketing will help your B2B brand grow awareness, you may still be a few steps removed from getting your boss on board. From conceptualizing content marketing campaigns to carrying them out, marketing teams already have hefty to-do lists. Researching and writing content, designing visual components, building ebooks and landing pages, hosting webinars – you and your team’s hands are probably already pretty full.</p>
<p>To your stakeholders, the idea of adding a relationship-building outreach component may bring up a few questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Concern that your brand’s messaging will lose its focus by bringing in other people to contribute,</li>
<li>Worry about a potential bottleneck to the content creation process, or</li>
<li>Doubt that pursuing influencers will contribute to your overall goal of generating more leads or sales.</li>
</ol>
<p>And yet for many B2B brands, influencer marketing is working – and it’s worth a shot for your brand, too. TopRank Marketing influencer content programs and those of clients like <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2013/02/social-media-predictions-2013/">Dell</a>, <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2014/01/linkedin-social-media-experts/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2014/08/content-marketing-strategy-ebook/">CMI</a> and <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2014/09/future-b2b-marketing-mpb2b/">MarketingProfs</a> are great examples of B2B influencer marketing in action.</p>
<p>To echo the Beatles, brands really do get by with &#8220;a little help from their friends&#8221;. So how do you communicate that vision to the powers that be?</p>
<h3>Be the expert</h3>
<p>Working with influencers is a whole new world for many B2B marketers. As the marketing expert spearheading the influencer marketing program, you will need to serve as the guide that your stakeholders can trust.</p>
<p>Help your boss and constituents understand what influencer marketing is and is not:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Influencer marketing <em>is</em></strong> aligning with prominent industry leaders in order to develop relationships with the goal of mutual promotion for everyone involved.</li>
<li><strong>Influencer marketing <em>is not </em></strong>stalking and schmoozing popular people with the hopes that their breeze will lift your sail.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on your company’s business goals, make sure you highlight how implementing an influencer content marketing program will help you achieve the bottom line – or contribute to facilitating the customer journey. Communicate the potential benefits of an influencer marketing program. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increased brand awareness where buyers and other influencers seek expert information</li>
<li>More awareness amongst industry media and blogs</li>
<li>More social engagement and social penetration for your content</li>
<li>In-depth expert content that can be repurposed in blogs, white papers, social messages, and more.</li>
<li>Lasting relationships with real people who matter to your industry</li>
<li>Contacts and leads</li>
<li>Shorter sales cycles</li>
</ul>
<h3>Show them the data</h3>
<p>There&#8217;s no guarantee of success with every new marketing initiative, but you can go in with some analytical confidence that you’re making a smart move with a clear line of sight to important business goals. In one study from Augure, 70% of marketers reported success from their influencer marketing efforts. From the consumer standpoint, numerous <a href="http://simplymeasured.com/blog/2014/06/18/influencer-marketing/" target="_blank">statistics</a> show that consumers listen to and trust what influential folks are saying on social media when they make purchasing decisions. Furthermore, <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/content/corporate/us/en/press-room/2012/nielsen-global-consumers-trust-in-earned-advertising-grows.html" target="_blank">92% of consumers</a> trust earned media, according to Nielsen.</p>
<p>Industry proof points will also help your stakeholders get on board with an influencer marketing program. Consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which of your competitors are moving in this direction?</li>
<li>Are there others in your industry who have chosen to pursue influencer marketing?</li>
</ul>
<p>Before you make your case, do a little research so you can say with confidence whether or not your company would be pioneers and leaders in this venture, or whether there is an opportunity to one-up what’s already being done.</p>
<p>As buyers become increasingly wary of brand-first, sales-oriented communications, the data definitely supports joining hands with influential friends in your industry to provide education, engagement and affect purchasing decisions.</p>
<h3>Share a game plan</h3>
<p>When pitching an influencer marketing program, bring a well-defined strategy, but be open for discussion. Will you go all in, or test how influencer outreach goes first? Starting small could mean wholeheartedly targeting a few quality influencers for an upcoming campaign, and then analyzing the results afterwards to gauge the success of the tactic.</p>
<p>Provide examples of a thought leader who is already speaking to your target audience – whether it’s a prominent expert who tweets hourly about the issues your C-suite executives are battling (that you can help them fix), or an entrepreneur who shares productivity tips with a following of business managers who may also need your B2B solution. Share <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2014/09/influencer-content-marketing-leeodden/">steps</a> for how you might attract, engage and partner with those influencers.</p>
<p>The success of a B2B influencer marketing program will ultimately depend on the cooperation of your selected influencers. But if you can make strategic outreach informed by social data to the right people, the results and relationships that come out of the initiative could truly be spectacular. If your stakeholders believe in the power of friendship and the notion that &#8220;a rising tide lifts all ships&#8221;, it’s likely that they’ll be enthusiastic about the prospect of an influencer marketing program, too.  With that consensus, your executives will be more willing to support whatever time and effort you need to make an influencer content marketing program happen.</p>
<p>I’d love to hear your thoughts. What other tips do you have for getting B2B buy-in for an influencer marketing program?</p>

<p>Precognitive Marketing, neural interfaces to marketing dashboards, Google cranial implants &#8211; is this science fiction or is it the future of B2B marketing? Maybe a bit of both!</p>
<p>These and many more insights (of the predictive and practical kind) can be found in our latest eBook, <a href="http://tprk.us/mpb2b14" target="_blank">The Future of B2B Marketing</a> as part of our promotions for <a href="http://mprofs.com/b2b14ebk" target="_blank">MarketingProfs B2B Forum</a>. With a conference theme of &#8220;Marketing for What Comes Next&#8221; we&#8217;ve connected with 31 of the top B2B marketers from Xerox to LinkedIn to Marketo to get their predictions about the future of marketing to businesses.</p>
<p><strong>The future of B2B marketing is far from boring</strong> and now, more than ever, B2B marketers are thinking creatively and dreaming big about new ways to attract, engage and inspire business buyers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17378" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/future-marketing-pr.jpg" alt="Future Marketing PR Events" width="500" height="284" /></p>
<p>As we enter the 4th quarter of 2014, many marketers will be focusing on what&#8217;s next for the coming year.</p>
<p>While most marketing planning for 2014 has &#8220;officially&#8221; occurred by now, let&#8217;s face it: things change fast in the digital marketing and PR world. Interest in the topics like the future of B2B marketing, Digital PR and Social Media will only grow as the year finishes out and into the next.</p>
<p>To satisfy that interest, we&#8217;ve already started publishing <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2014/05/digital-marketing-2015/">marketing predictions</a> for next year and with over 9,000 social shares, the future is definitely on every marketer&#8217;s mind. Besides posting predictions, I&#8217;m also going to be giving presentations at 3 different events in the coming months about what&#8217;s next in B2B, PR and Social Media. Here are details on each:</p>
<p><a href="http://mprofs.com/b2b14ebk" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17375" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/b2b-forum-header-5001.png" alt="MarketingProfs B2B Marketing Forum" width="500" height="116" /><br />
</a><strong><a href="http://mprofs.com/b2b14ebk" target="_blank">MarketingProfs B2B Marketing Forum<br />
</a></strong>Oct 8-11, 2014<br />
Boston, MA</p>
<p>The theme of the 8th year of this amazing conference is &#8220;Marketing for What&#8217;s Next&#8221;. With a lineup of top B2B marketers ranging from Michael Brenner to Pam Didner to Jason Miller, it will not disappoint.</p>
<p>Inspirational keynote speakers will be on hand as well including Mr. UnMarketing himself, <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2014/09/interview-scott-stratten-mpb2b/">Scott Stratten</a>; author and designer <a href="https://twitter.com/austinkleon" target="_blank">Austin Kleon</a> and pioneering social media researcher, <a href="https://twitter.com/zephoria" target="_blank">danah boyd</a> (who has also been honored in our <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2011/06/25-women-rock-social-media-2011/">25 women who rock social media</a> list).</p>
<p>I will be presenting on what I think will be a high growth marketing area for 2015 involving participation marketing: <strong>&#8220;Influencing B2B Influencers and the Magic of Co-Created Social Content&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Companies are investing in content marketing and social media more than ever, yet in an age of information overload, standing out on the social web can require unreasonable budgets and resources. But what if you could hack your way to the spotlight by helping everybody win?</p>
<p>Operating with minimal resources, a growing number of marketers are creating better quality content that gets shared more often, reaches more readers and grows their influencer network &#8211; all at the same time. In this presentation you will learn:<br />
&#8211; Case studies for doing it right (and wrong)<br />
&#8211; How to identify, qualify and engage influencers<br />
&#8211; The mechanics of co-created content<br />
&#8211; Performance measurement and optimization</p>

<p>I am happy to share that we are publishing a conference eBook for #MPB2B that features predictions from over 30 of the conference speakers. B2B brands contributing include Xerox, Marketo, LinkedIn and Silverpop. B2B Marketing thought leaders include Ann Handley, Heidi Cohen, Tom Webster, Doug Kessler, Susan Emerick, Viveka von Rosen, Jon Miller and many more. Be sure to check back tomorrow for the full eBook and a few surprises.</p>

<a href="http://www.prsa.org/Conferences/InternationalConference/" target="_blank"><strong>PRSA International Conference</strong><br />
</a>October 12-14, 2014<br />
Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>The theme of this year&#8217;s PRSA International conference is also future focused: &#8220;Leading the Way &#8211; A Fearless Future for PR&#8221;.</p>
<p>Keynotes include media luminaries from Good Morning America, Fast Company, NBC, and Facebook. With more than 90 instructional sessions on all variety of communications, public and media relations topics, this is one of the largest PR focused events of the year.</p>
<p>As the convergence of public relations with other disciplines continues, there are more marketing focused topics being presented, including my own session: &#8220;<strong>The Future of Digital PR is Integrated&#8221;. </strong></p>
<p>How to win hearts, minds and wallets with an integrated marketing approach. Singular channels of digital marketing and communications are no longer effective. The changing digital media landscape combined with more sophisticated consumer behaviors means brands are competing for time and attention with other companies as well as their customers. You will learn:<br />
· The foundation of an integrated marketing and PR strategy.<br />
· A marketing case study that integrated PR<br />
· A public relations case study that integrated marketing</p>
<p>If you want to get a firm grasp on the intersection of digital PR and marketing, <a href="http://www.prsa.org/Conferences/InternationalConference/" target="_blank">this event is a must attend</a>.</p>

</a><a href="http://www.whitepapersource.com/cmd.php?Clk=5297512" target="_blank"><strong>Social Media Success Summit</strong><br />
</a>October 7-30, 2014<br />
Online Event</p>
<p>Put on by the social media smart folks at Social Media Examiner, this event lasts most of October and it&#8217;s  online. You can experience and interact in real time or you can watch presentations at a time that is convenient. The range of topics at this online event will certainly give you a kick start into the future of social media in 2015 and beyond.</p>
<p>The speaker list at the Social Media Success Summit is literally a who’s who of social media marketing including: Jay Baer, Mari Smith, Mike Stelzner, Mark Schaefer, Amy Porterfield, Cliff Ravenscraft and many more. Brands are well represented as presenters as well including: Tyson Foods, Humana, Dunkin’ Donuts, Whole Foods Market, Canva and more.</p>
<p>Along with Todd Wheatland and Joe Pulizzi, I will be focusing on a growing area of focus for many companies: content marketing for social media. My presentation will be given on Monday, October 27 at 1pm Pacific (4pm Eastern): <strong>&#8220;How to Create Content That Will Win You More Fans, Customers and Advocates&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>With a cornucopia of content marketing possibilities available to businesses large and small, many marketers don’t know what kind of content will help them break free from competitors without using huge marketing budgets. This presentation will provide a framework and examples for a competitive content marketing plan using 4 types of content: evergreen, repurposed, curated and co-created to help your business attract, engage and convert more fans into customers &#8211; without breaking the bank.</p>
<p>The Social Media Success Summit is going to be a great event! Be sure to check out the <a href="http://www.whitepapersource.com/cmd.php?Clk=5297512" target="_blank">entire agenda</a> and speaker roster as well as the online networking options.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;">What are your predictions about B2B Marketing, Digital PR and Social Media Marketing? </span></h3>
<p>Is B2B really going away in favor of P2P? Will PR actually merge entirely with marketing? Will social media disperse to specialty apps or aggregate into just one or two monster social platforms to rule them all?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love hear your thoughts. I also hope to see you at one or more of these 3 events, so be sure to check them out!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/social_media_marketing_storytelling.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17355" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/social_media_marketing_storytelling.jpg" alt="storytelling in b2b marketing" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>
<p>Storytelling is a fundamentally human experience. We love to tell stories, ranging from whimsical fantasy to tense political thrillers. Some psychologists believe storytelling is actually <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/am-i-right/201308/story-telling-is-necessary-human-survival" target="_blank">necessary for human survival</a> &#8212; we are hard-wired to respond to compelling narratives.</p>
<p>Storytelling is <a href="http://www.bruceclay.com/blog/how-to-use-storytelling-for-content-marketing/" target="_blank">frequently</a> <a href="http://www.i-scoop.eu/art-storytelling-6-content-marketing-context-questions/" target="_blank">cited</a> as a best practice for content marketers, but what happens when your publishing space is limited? B2B social media marketers only have enough space for 1-2 sentences per post, so how can they tell a story with such little space?</p>
<p>When it comes to effective B2B social storytelling, it’s not about shrinking the story to fit within character limits. Rather, it’s about using social tools to make the story bigger. Here’s how you can make your story bigger on social networks:</p>
<h3>Visualize the message</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Social_Media_Marketing_cisco_on_Instagram.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-17352 size-full" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Social_Media_Marketing_cisco_on_Instagram.jpg" alt="social media marketing, star wars, cisco" width="500" height="493" /></a></p>
<p>The first lesson B2B marketers need to know about storytelling with microcontent is that they aren’t restricted by copy character limits in social messaging. There are multiple opportunities to enhance social network posts with visual content, and it’s simply more effective for generating customer engagement: 44% of social media users are <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/performics_us/performics-life-on-demand-2012-summary-deck" target="_blank">more likely to engage</a> with a brand that posts photos versus other media.</p>
<p>Consider these steps when integrating visual elements with your B2B micro-content on social networks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Convey emotion</strong> – How should the customer feel after skimming this social post in their feeds? Emotion isn’t restricted to B2C – B2B content can be visually stimulating while still sharing clear facts and figures.</li>
<li><strong>Use a variety of visual elements</strong> – Videos, infographics, memes, comics, SlideShares, quotes, etc. Your B2B brand’s story can be told through more than just photos. Cisco capitalized on a popular event (Star Wars Day, May 4th) to play with the sci-fi interests of their audience.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Address human needs</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Social_Media_Marketing_Bit9_Pinterest.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17353" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Social_Media_Marketing_Bit9_Pinterest.jpg" alt="social media marketing, bit9" width="500" height="323" /></a></p>
<p>Brand storyteller Kathy Klotz-Guest argues that B2B content should <a href="http://keepingithuman.com/hey-product-officer-product-story-sucks-shake-product-marketing-marketing-story-part-i/" target="_blank">elevate the product or service</a> to address the human needs of the audience. Marketers need to share the inherent customer needs with their content – and social media offers a venue to highlight the most important examples. Your story thus becomes centered on the customer, while still highlighting what is important to your business.</p>
<p>Anti-virus software Bit 9 utilizes its <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/search/?q=Bit9Blog" target="_blank">Pinterest board</a> to focus on the crucial cyber security issues that all B2B businesses face each day. Fear of data breaches is a common human emotion in many IT departments, so Bit 9 provides a visual, social service with their content on Pinterest.</p>
<p>Try these tactics to infuse more customer-centric value in your social messaging:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use statistics to reinforce the message</strong> – Statistics and percentages help punctuate the story.</li>
<li><strong>Share customer feedback directly</strong> – Share insights from case studies to present the user experience from the customer’s point of view.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Develop and advance the narrative</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/social_media_marketing_dell_valueprop.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17354" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/social_media_marketing_dell_valueprop.jpg" alt="social media marketing, b2b, dell" width="500" height="323" /></a></p>
<p>Good storytellers build narratives that weave through every piece of applicable content. LinkedIn’s Jason Miller (a TopRank client) believes that strong brand stories are told through “remarkable anecdotes”, strung together to advance the narrative. Each of these anecdotes can be promoted individually in social, yet they all serve to shape the ongoing brand story.</p>
<p>Dell (another TopRank client) accomplishes this goal through their “point-of-view” campaigns, which develop content narratives and spread them across their social channels. Each post and anecdote that ties back to the main content serves to advance the narrative, and they utilize a <a href="https://twitter.com/DellEnterprise/status/482891173053620225" target="_blank">variety of visual elements</a> to convey that message.</p>
<p>Use these insights to advance your B2B narrative for social storytelling:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Include insights from the “main character”</strong> – Who are the stars of your narrative? Use social messaging and visuals to share their progress.</li>
<li><strong>Share personal details</strong> – Provided your company’s brand guidelines allow for personal sharing, have your subject matter experts post and comment on content that advances the narrative.</li>
</ul>
<p>Have you developed a story that works with the microcontent in your B2B social media marketing? How did the story develop through your company’s social channels? Please share your thoughts with us in the comments!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17358" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/writers-guide-cta.jpg" alt="Writers Guide Calls to Action CTA" width="500" height="408" /></p>
<p><em>Note from Lee: Please welcome Andy Thomson from TopRank in his first post to Online Marketing Blog:</em></p>
<p>In managing the content marketing for a brand, you have to focus on the bottom line. You have to push sales to help you reach growth goals for the business. But in reality, most people who encounter your brand (especially in B2B) aren’t going to buy right away. The sales funnel has to attract, engage and convert people in a way that makes sense for them.</p>
<p>As content creators and marketers, knowing how and when to use calls to action to move prospective customers from awareness to purchase can be tricky. Luckily, last week&#8217;s Content Marketing World offered a flood of great content advice on the interwebs including insights on follow throughs and calls to action (CTA). Here are a few of those nuggets and some perspective:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Every piece of content should have a CTA! <a href="https://twitter.com/dmccaff">@dmccaff</a> on today&#8217;s getting buy in from the c-suite webinar! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/cmworld?src=hash">#cmworld</a></p>
<p>— Content Marketing (@CMIContent) <a href="https://twitter.com/CMIContent/status/476793465649774592">June 11, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script>The <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2014/08/content-marketing-roi-ebook/">content marketing ROI</a> revolution is upon us, so creating a path and purpose in your content is required. For a writer, the call to action (CTA) can’t just be a big orange button that says BUY NOW. Your content plan needs to guide the reader through various stages to a sale. For a content type like a blog, the message is usally addressing a reader at a high position of the funnel, so the CTA should be a much softer sell than the one on your gated content or product page.</p>
<p>Within an ebook, social post, blog, or even content hosted on Slideshare, focus on coaxing your reader to move to the next step in the sales cycle with copy that serves a specific purpose. Here are some CTA tips supported by experts from Content Marketing World that will help you do just that.</p>
<p><strong>Nurture Them:</strong> With prospective buyers in the early stage, awareness and interest are the top goals for content.  When attracting and engaging buyers, content should bring them around to your ideas and eventually land them at your products. Here’s lesson from content guru, Jay Acunzo’s session:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>
Great CTA from <a href="https://twitter.com/Jay_zo">@jay_zo</a> for marketers, don’t aim for the click, aim to win he hearts of your audience <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/cmworld?src=hash">#cmworld</a> — Cindy Valladares (@cindyv) <a href="https://twitter.com/cindyv/status/509735569946333184">September 10, 2014</a>
</p></blockquote>
<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><strong>Inspire Action: </strong>Whether it&#8217;s within social media posts, meta content, or the end of a blog post, a writer needs to create motivation for the next action, even if it’s just fostering a relationship. This requires using action verbs and plain creativity.</p>
<p>Hotshot keynote speaker Andrew Davis offered this tidbit:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/vegecomgirl">@VegeComGirl</a> &#8211; Some of the best content has no CTA. There&#8217;s an implied action that sparks a new journey! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CMWorld?src=hash">#CMWorld</a></p>
<p>— Andrew Davis (@TPLDrew) <a href="https://twitter.com/TPLDrew/status/489078727834226688">July 15, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script><strong>Utilize Online Tools: </strong>While a simple thesaurus is always a writer&#8217;s friend, you can now a/b test different options and track your results with different technology and techniques including tools like Optimizely. On social networks, there are a set of actions the user is likely to take aside from clicking your link.</p>
<p>For some guidance, Twitter has <a href="https://business.twitter.com/write-good-tweets" target="_blank">listed writing tips</a> for brands who are advertising on their platform. Bernie Borges made this point about finding a tool that works for you: </p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>
A5 social media tools must facilitate decision making, results measurement, to be useful. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/cmworld?src=hash">#cmworld</a> — Bernie Borges (@bernieborges) <a href="https://twitter.com/bernieborges/status/494158679927980032">July 29, 2014</a>
</p></blockquote>
<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><strong>Don’t Tease:  </strong>Tricks and teases aren’t what anyone wants. Even Facebook is cracking down on click baiting schemes. Tell your audience what they’ll get at the next page, so if that’s what they want, they can have it.</p>
<p>Readers want clarity and will reward you for it. They’re already looking at your brand, and maybe a blog post at this point, so leave the sidebar buttons and forms to the designers and provide the reader with enough information to lead them to the next logical step in their journey from awareness to purchase.</p>
<p>In his typically poignant style, Kevin Spacey addressed this during his own CMWorld keynote:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Content: “Give people what they want, in the form they want it, at a reasonable price &amp; they won’t want to steal it.” <a href="https://twitter.com/KevinSpacey">@kevinspacey</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CMWorld?src=hash">#CMWorld</a></p>
<p>— Lee Odden (@leeodden) <a href="https://twitter.com/leeodden/status/509809157453918208">September 10, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Writing great content takes work, but the call to action and its purpose cannot be forgotten in lieu of creativity.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17346" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/annhandley-c2c-photobytoprank1.jpg" alt="Ann Handley " width="500" height="332" /></p>
<p>The bell has rung and class is in session.</p>
<p>The topic? Creating content. In particular, ridiculously good content.</p>
<p>Your professor for this essential business skill is none other than <a href="http://annhandley.com" target="_blank">Ann Handley</a>, Chief Content Officer of MarketingProfs, the largest marketing community on the web. During the incredibly busy week that was Content Marketing World, Ann took the time to exceed my expectations (once again) and shine her bright light of wisdom on the power of good writing.</p>
<p>In business and in life, writing is an essential part of communications &#8211; no matter how digital, virtual and science fiction we get in our communications. That&#8217;s why Ann&#8217;s new book launching today, <em><strong><a href="http://annhandley.com/everybodywrites/" target="_blank">Everybody Writes</a>: Your Go-To Guide to Creating Ridiculously Good Content</strong></em>, is so timely.  From Twitter to White Papers to books in print, Ann has smart, actionable advice for us all.</p>
<p><strong>Let&#8217;s get to it. Ann, are you ready to talk about creating ridiculously good content? Please pick 6 of the following questions to answer:</strong></p>
<p>Sure…  grab some pops and nachos and hang over here for a few. You ask. I’ll answer.</p>
<p><a href="http://annhandley.com/everybodywrites/"><img class="alignright wp-image-17347 size-medium" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/everybody-writes-cover1-211x300.jpg" alt="Everybody Writes Book Cover" width="211" height="300" hspace="5" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What do you love about writing?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t particularly LOVE writing – it’s hard work, and I’m slow at it. ? But I love to read good writing. And I love to have written!</p>
<p>And more generally: I do love the way the process of writing forces a deeper clarity of thought and an empathy for the reader: What am I trying to say really? Am I making this crystal clear for the person I’m trying to reach?</p>
<p>So writing is thinking. And for us as marketers, good writing is good marketing, too: Because when we swap places with our readers during that editing, we are getting inside our customer’s heads to figure out what will matter to them. To create content with meaning for them.</p>
<p><strong>Intellectually, it makes all the sense in the world to create meaningful content. At the same time, the ADD generation is decidedly short form when it comes to writing. A great example is that almost no one live-blogs at conferences anymore, they &#8220;live tweet.&#8221; How can we get millennials excited about writing again?</strong></p>
<p>Well, isn’t tweeting writing? The words we use on Twitter matter as much as the words we use anywhere else.</p>
<p>Writing doesn’t have to be long to be meaningful. I’d argue that the words we use everywhere – on our websites, on our landing pages, on our LinkedIn profiles and so on – are just as important as the words we use in places we typically think of as “writing.”</p>
<p>Our words are our ambassadors – they tell the world who we are no matter where they appear. And that’s true whether they appear in a tweet, or in this answer right here, right now….</p>
<p><strong>With 28 writing rules in Part 1 of <em>Everybody Writes</em>, it can seem overwhelming to a mediocre writer like myself. What are 3 of the most important writing rules you can recommend so that people like me can write better?</strong></p>
<p>The last thing I wanted to do was produce a writing guide that was as impenetrable and heavy as a swimming pool full of wet cement. And truly, those “rules” are more like bumpers on a bowling lane than hard and fast rules – and in that spirit I encourage any Content McGyvers out there to break them as they wish!</p>
<p>But if I had to choose three: I’d suggest these:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Shed high school rules.</strong> (There really is no one right way to write.)</li>
<li><strong>Follow a writing GPS</strong>. (Having a sense of what path you’re taking makes the journey less anxious.)</li>
<li><strong>Embrace the Ugly First Draft.</strong> Everyone writes badly on a first draft; the key is to be an excellent editor of your own work on subsequent drafts.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Awesomesauce is a Frankenword? Oh the irony! Where do such rules apply when it comes to humor and adding language to conversational content like blogs and social media?</strong></p>
<p>I’m allergic to the word “awesomesauce” and other Frankenwords (like “amazeballs” and “clickability.”) But they bother me less than obese words (almost any word with –ation as a suffix) and jargony “fake words.”</p>
<p>Such words to my ear are the chemical additives of writing – you can use one or two of them sparingly but too many can make you content toxic.</p>
<p>Humor and conversational content is another matter entirely. Most of the content we produce should be conversational – using lots of “yous” and “us” and not so many “our customers” and “the organization.” Corporate-speak like that makes you sound off-putting and impersonal in this post Cluetrain Manifesto-era.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the most common grammar and usage rules you see being broken with business content?</strong></p>
<p>Part of me doesn’t want to answer this, on the grounds that too many people equate writing with grammar, when it’s so much more than that.</p>
<p>Writing is more about thinking and creating great content experiences for your reader, customer or user. That’s why the “grammar” stuff in the book is second – because in my mind while grammar is important, it’s secondary to the idea, the message and the writing itself.</p>
<p>But since you asked so nicely… and because I like you: I’d say the most common errors I’ve noticed in 25 (!) years of editing business people and marketers are these:</p>
<p><strong>1. Wordiness.</strong> Both in specific words (why use “at which time” when you might say “when”?) as well as indulgent, bloated blog posts and other longer-form content. Writing with stylish economy is a gift you can give your readers.</p>
<p><strong>2. Using this/that and these/those</strong> when the antecedent isn’t clear. I see this ALL THE TIME. Especially at the beginning of the sentence. This drives me nuts. (What drives me nuts? The sentence? The usage? The question? See what I mean?)</p>
<p><strong>Please name 3 ways a company can get to know their audience better to inform content topics?</strong></p>
<p>Is this the sixth question? I’ve lost count. And you said to answer only six. Anyway, I like that you say “please.” It a small gesture, but it’s nice.</p>
<p>So, as for the answer: certainly getting out and talking to people is key. A lot of marketers I know rarely talk to customers – very often, only customer service or sales does. So, ask customers what they think. Watch how they behave. Look for patterns. I do this via social platforms, too: Twitter is a great listening tool, but many companies use it to listen only for sales opportunities or (worse) they use it to broadcast only.</p>
<p>Pay attention to context as well. Avoid grouping customers in an artificial setting like a focus group. Instead, meet them in their natural habitat so you can get a better sense of how they interact with your content and your site and whatever it is that you do or sell.</p>
<p>And finally: Be a natural skeptic of your own work. Ask So what? about every piece of content you create – and then answer it with a Because. Ask/answer until you uncover the true value for a customer. Why does this matter to them? Why should they care? I wrote a bit more about that here. http://www.marketingprofs.com/articles/2014/25986/writing-gps-for-ridiculously-good-content</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s the balance between content that empathizes with the customer and content that communicates information to help prospects to buy? We should be able to do both, right?</strong></p>
<p>Those two things are the same thing, to me. The best content answers the questions that customers have – or might have if they knew enough to ask.</p>
<p>So content that helps people make important decisions about their lives is a kind of gift you can give your customers or prospects. The key is to take your product or service out of the starring role – and let it play the supporting role of helping the customer.</p>
<p>The best content marketing isn’t about what you do or what you sell – it’s about how what that thing does for others. That’s a subtle shift, but an important one, and a hard one for companies to truly embrace. (And I say that with love in my heart and with no judgment. I get it.)</p>
<p><strong>What is brand journalism and when does it make sense for a business to include that approach with their content marketing and communications?</strong></p>
<p>Some companies are looking toward traditional journalism to fill the gaping content maw; they are hiring those trained in J-school tactics, such as reporting and storytelling, as in-house brand journalists. A brand journalist or corporate reporter works inside the company, writing and producing videos, blog posts, photos, webinars, charts, graphs, e-books, podcasts, and other information that delivers value to your market.</p>
<p>In short, brand journalists bring a reporter’s sensibility to your content—an editorial approach to building a brand.</p>
<p>That approach is especially useful when we all need to place the needs of our audience first and rise above our corporate-centric messaging. Journalists’ innate understanding of audience means that every time they sit down at their desks to create content, a little voice in the back of their head reminds them: Nobody has to read this. That kind of pressure on your content-creation efforts can only benefit your brand and enhance your integrity.</p>
<p><strong>With so many different platforms, people and situations, is there really such a thing as universal rules guiding the ideal length for blog posts and social media updates?</strong></p>
<p>Ah, you’re referring to Part V: Things Marketers Write. It is one of the more prescriptive parts of the book, so here’s what I’d say:</p>
<p>There is no way one to write, just as there is no one way to parent a child or roast a turkey. (And that’s true of writing social media updates, too.) But there are terrible ways of doing all three things.</p>
<p>So in Part V I’m offering a starting point for companies who aren’t sure where to begin writing a Facebook page update or LinkedIn profile or blog post or landing page or how to use hashtags… or the like.</p>
<p>As I said, Content McGyvers can feel free to toss this section entirely – it’s a section I considered NOT including in the book, because the general approach in the previous four sections confers enough guidance, I thought. But ironically Part V is the section many marketers seem to dig, based on early feedback.</p>
<p>So what do I know? Is there more salsa?</p>
<p><strong>How do you suggest marketers organize writing differently for each social channel? Is it a single idea written different ways or different ideas per channel?</strong></p>
<p>I think it’s more important for marketers to adopt a point-of-view; a clear voice. And then, adapt it to the audiences on those channels.</p>
<p><strong>What are 3 of your favorite content tools? What do you use daily?</strong></p>
<p>I use Word and WordPress daily. But calling them content “tools” is a little like calling underwear part of your OOTD. Technically, yes. But no one really calls out the basics.</p>
<p>I also regularly use Instagram (my own, as a source of content images) and Scrivener, for longer content projects like books and ebooks. That’s four. Oops. I’m terrible at math. Clearly.</p>
<p><strong>What content tool do you wish existed now (but doesn&#8217;t)? What would it do?</strong></p>
<p>Hmm. Good question. I already <a href="http://www.annhandley.com/2008/02/13/how-i-invented-blogging/" target="_blank">invented blogging</a>.</p>
<p>And I wish I invented Instagram. But alas.</p>

<p><strong>Any future predictions on the state of &#8220;content marketing&#8221; in the next 5 years? Hot or not?</strong></p>
<p>HOT. Or actually…. Let’s not say HOT. Because that implies a fad, a trend, a passing fancy.</p>
<p>Let’s just say that great content is great marketing. And that will be more true in the next five years than it is now. Which is to say – VERY!</p>
<p>I just realized I answered all of these, didn’t I? See “bad at math” comment, again.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17335" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Jason-Miller-and-Shafqat-Islam.jpg" alt="Jason Miller and Shafqat Islam" width="500" height="373" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s another packed house in the ROI track with LinkedIn&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/JasonMillerCA" target="_blank">Jason Miller</a> and NewsCred&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/shafqatislam" target="_blank">Shafqat Islam</a> taking the stage after Shane Snow&#8217;s inspiring session. The duo did not disappoint. When it was over, the gentleman seated behind me said, &#8220;that was the best presentation I&#8217;ve seen yet.&#8221; The gentleman next to him concurred.</p>
<p>Shafqat kicked it off with a fantastic segue from Shane Snow&#8217;s Che Guevara story, telling the crowd about the Che poster he proudly displayed on his wall when he was younger. He then cited the following George Bernard Shaw quote:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>If at age 20 you are not a communist then you have no heart. If at age 30 you are not a capitalist then you have no brains.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>What a perfect way to introduce the topic of content creation and ROI.</p>
<p>Next, Jason took the stage and did some &#8220;face melting&#8221; with his amazing insights and delivery style. I&#8217;m extremely fortunate for the opportunity to work with, and learn from, brilliant marketers like Jason Miller and his tag-team partner Deanna Lazzaroni at LinkedIn Marketing Solutions on a regular basis.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t possibly cover all the helpful information Jason and Shafqat shared in less than five blog posts, so hopefully I can pass along some of the value provided with my three top takeaways.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway #1: Don&#8217;t over-complicate content marketing ROI</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;We seem to complicate this stuff even though its not too complicated,&#8221; said Jason, before revealing the one job of content marketers: empathizing with prospects and customers.</p>
<p>The answer is not <em>more</em> content. The answer is more <em>relevant</em> content, and content marketers can get to the point, optimally, via insights. Jason believes that analyzing the following three (and only three) metrics will reveal everything you need to know about the effectiveness of your content:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Referral traffic:</strong> If more people are discovering your content by means other than branded searches, this is a good sign that it&#8217;s resonating</li>
<li><strong>Social engagement:</strong> Sharing is a sign of relevance. It indicates you are connecting with your audience. Even if it&#8217;s only ten shares, if it inspires shares by the right people, that&#8217;s all you need</li>
<li><strong>Lead quality:</strong> If people are entering the funnel and are converting more quickly, it&#8217;s a sign that your content is connecting and nurturing</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Takeaway #2: Consumers love packaged content and content marketers should too</strong></p>
<p>Jason cited Doug Kessler&#8217;s advice to focus on hitting one home run per quarter. Marketers can accomplish this with a big rock piece of content. One piece of content can fill an editorial calendar with social shares and blog posts for weeks on end. Marketers can also drive greater ROI and efficiency by creating themed content that can be aggregated into a big rock piece of content later.</p>
<p><strong>3 ways to create big rock content</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Create the all-encompassing guide to whatever the hell conversation you want to own</li>
<li>The Hugh MacLeod strategy: write a series of relevant blog posts then roll them into a nice package</li>
<li>Flip your case studies on their heads. Turn your bottom funnel case studies into success stories, as Pantheon did with their &#8220;8 Amazing Drupal Launches&#8221; piece</li>
</ol>
<p><iframe src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/31136699" width="425" height="355" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"> </iframe></p>
<p><strong>Takeaway #3: Content marketing ROI begins with proper organization of the marketing team</strong></p>
<p>To ensure efficiency and consistency, the entire team needs to be aligned. Jason&#8217;s Kiss slide explained this perfectly:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Kiss-Content-Team.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-17334" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Kiss-Content-Team-300x223.jpg" alt="Kiss Content Team" width="300" height="223" /></a></p>
<p>The only things missing here are Kiss&#8217;s manager (PR) and the amazing shows they produce (event marketing). Kiss built a thriving community by working harmoniously, and content marketing teams can do the same. Your community doesn&#8217;t need to be as large as the Kiss Army to drive results, they just need to be engaged. Creating engaging content is easier when all the moving parts of your marketing team are moving toward the same objectives.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17333" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Shane-Snow-CM-World.jpg" alt="Shane Snow" width="500" height="373" /></p>
<p>Back in August of &#8217;13, Contently co-founder <a title="Shane Snow Twitter Profile" href="https://twitter.com/shanesnow" target="_blank">Shane Snow</a> wrote the following in a LinkedIn Influencer post:</p>
<p>“Every few minutes, a new buzzword rips through the business world, skids, gets a few books written on it, and ends up in a pile of tired terms next to ‘synergy.’ Today, one of the biggest corporate buzzwords is ‘storytelling.’ Marketers are obsessed with storytelling and conference panels on the subject have fewer empty seats than a Bieber concert.</p>
<p>Funny thing is, storytelling has been <em>the buzzword</em> off and on since advertising became a thing. It’s always coming out of the buzzword pile because, at the end of the day, storytelling is a skill. Stories have been an essential driver of change throughout human history. For good and for ill.”</p>
<p>About a year has passed since Shane penned this insightful passage, and the buzz surrounding both storytelling and Biebs has only intensified. One continues to be lauded for its meaningful contribution to society, and the other, well&#8230;</p>
<p>In his Content Marketing World presentation this morning, Shane offered a compelling case for storytelling via, what else, stories. Here are three of the many outstanding stories Shane shared, along with a quick content marketing takeaway from each story. Hopefully my effort to explain Shane&#8217;s stories concisely does not dilute the message.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;I want to die on Mars&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>This is how Elon Musk described his motivation for making space travel available to the public. Shane put it best by saying this statement made people &#8220;care violently,&#8221; certainly more so than if Musk would have instead promoted the potential ROI of public space travel. Musk&#8217;s statement tapped into the curiosity and dreams of billionaires, helping him garner enough backing for three trial launches.</p>
<p>All three launches failed, with the &#8220;final&#8221; launch exploding in spectacular fashion. Everyone was dejected. But Musk carried on, more determined than ever. Ultimately it was Musk&#8217;s singleness of purpose and his ability to convey his purpose &#8211; he told his dejected backers that this was his dream and he&#8217;d never give up &#8211; that inspired the funding for a fourth launch. Not only did the next launch succeed, but Musk&#8217;s rocket was able to perform capabilities, like landing vertically, that NASA has yet to achieve.</p>
<p><strong>The takeaway:</strong> Storytelling is how content marketers get audiences to &#8220;care violently&#8221; about an organization&#8217;s purpose and values. An underlying, powerful story is the backbone that supports a brand&#8217;s overarching message. It aligns your organization&#8217;s purpose with the motivations of your audience.</p>
<p><strong>Which beggar would you give your dollar to?</strong></p>
<p>Sign 1: Homeless, I need help.</p>
<p>Sign 2: Mom told us to wait here. That was ten years ago.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll admit, I guessed the second sign would be more effective. I was wrong. Shane&#8217;s research showed the majority of people would rather give their dollar to the beggar holding the first sign.</p>
<p><strong>The takeaway:</strong> Not any story will do. Humans are built to discern stories. The second sign offered an intriguing story. The first one passed the sniff test, and that&#8217;s why it ultimately won out.</p>
<p><strong>A content marketing revolution</strong></p>
<p>Ernesto was a thoughtful young man from Argentina who became a doctor because he wanted to change the world. You probably know Ernesto by his more familiar name: Che Guevara. Fast forward a few years (and probably past some essential details) and Che is in Cuba, aspiring to start a people&#8217;s revolution with Fidel Castro. The first attempt to revolutionize Cuba is done with brute force. It fails miserably, with Che and Fidel among the dozen of the 80-ish attackers who managed to escape with their lives.</p>
<p>Fast forward again, and now Che and Fidel are using a different strategy to spark their revolution: pirate radio. At first, the radio broadcasts were largely ineffective. They had listeners, but most listened solely for entertainment value.</p>
<p>So Che and Fidel tried something new. They started teaching peasants how they could become more successful, largely with farming tips. Their ranks went from a couple hundred to a couple thousand almost overnight. This helpful &#8220;content&#8221; allowed Cuba&#8217;s citizens to identify with the revolutionary message. Meanwhile, Cuba&#8217;s dictator was issuing propaganda that no longer passed the sniff test for many of the citizens. Che and Fidel&#8217;s underlying story of aspiration served to build relationships with the peasants of Cuba. They called their target audience to action again, this time with more success.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/content-marketing-revolution.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-17332" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/content-marketing-revolution-300x198.jpg" alt="content marketing revolution" width="300" height="198" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The takeaway:</strong> It is better to tell the truth, even if it is small, rather than an embellished lie. Content marketers can rally audiences by using stories that speak to the truth behind their aspirations.</p>
<p>Big thanks to Shane Snow for the amazing session, and apologies for not giving his stories the full detail they deserve. I look forward to reading Shane&#8217;s new book, <em>Smartcuts: How Hackers, Innovators, and Icons Accelerate Success</em>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17329" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/lee-odden-cmworld-2014.jpg" alt="Lee Odden" width="420" height="260" /></p>
<p>At the largest content marketing conference in the world, over 2,500 attendees from 50+ countries converged on Cleveland, Ohio this week to learn about all things content marketing. Our agency, TopRank Online Marketing, has been involved with CMWorld since day one: presenting every year for the past 4 years as well as helping to market the conference through influencer eBooks. Saying we&#8217;re big fans of the event is an understatement.</p>
<p>As it happens, my first session at Content Marketing World was presented by our CEO, Lee Odden on the topic of influencers and content marketing.</p>
<p><strong>What is an influencer?</strong> In a recent interview featured in Ann Handley&#8217;s <a title="4 Ways to Get Influencers to Spread Your Brand's Message" href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/236329" target="_blank">Entrepreneur Magazine</a> column, Lee described influencers as having &#8220;subject matter authority, credibility amongst a network and most importantly, the ability to affect actions amongst a network.&#8221;</p>
<p>For content marketers, the challenge is to move past the &#8220;how can we gain entry into the influencer&#8217;s network?&#8221; mindset, to instead focus on content partnership opportunities that deliver value on the key topics audiences care about. In his 2014 Content Marketing World presentation, <em><a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2014/09/content-influencer-marketing/">Content + Influencer Marketing = Powerful Way to Grow Your Business</a>, </em>Lee provided five fundamental steps content marketers can follow to plan, implement and optimize influencer marketing programs.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Influencer identification</strong></p>
<p>Make a choice on the topic or theme you want to be associated with. Then, use social tools such as <a href="http://traackr.com/" target="_blank">Traackr</a>, <a href="http://buzzsumo.com/" target="_blank">BuzzSumo</a>, <a href="http://www.getlittlebird.com/" target="_blank">Little Bird</a> or <a href="http://keyhole.co/" target="_blank">Keyhole</a> to identify those who exert influence on your topic. It&#8217;s important to distinguish between those who are popular and those who inspire action because underwhelming results can occur when you engage people who appear popular, but in actuality are &#8220;white noise&#8221; to the discussion surrounding the topic.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>A brandividual is popular. An influencer is effective at creating popularity.</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, use self-validation to ensure the identified influencers are producing quality content that aligns with your objectives. Trust your judgement of quality and don&#8217;t be afraid to shine a light on up-and-comers who are producing quality work. As Lee said, &#8220;work with an influencer, they&#8217;re friends for a day. Help someone become influential and they&#8217;re a friend for life.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Influencer <del>stalking</del> engagement</strong></p>
<p>Now that you have identified and validated your target influencers, it&#8217;s on to romancing them. A few ways you can do this are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share status updates</li>
<li>Comment on blog posts</li>
<li>Liveblog their session</li>
<li>Interview them</li>
<li>Co-create content (you can take the lead on this with thoughtful curation)</li>
<li>Interact with them at events, or take advantage of other opportunities to interact &#8220;in real life&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3: Influencer recruitment</strong></p>
<p>The simple rule here is to make it super easy for people to participate. A modular approach to content &#8212; a tactic that allows influencers to contribute small pieces of information which you can aggregate into a larger anchor piece &#8212; makes for easy participation. You can also go the other way with modular content, using influencer contributions in social messages, blog posts and newsletters.</p>
<p>Lee keeps copies of his outreach emails and tracks how well they perform, which allows him to optimize the process. He finds using the word &#8220;invitation&#8221; in the subject line helps, and providing a visual example can help influencers grasp the context of their participation. You should also use the names of those who have already agreed to participate as others may feel compelled to participate because they &#8220;belong&#8221; with your current participants. The image below shows even more components of an effective outreach message.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Influencer-Recruitment-Example.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-17325 size-full" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Influencer-Recruitment-Example.png" alt="Influencer Recruitment Example" width="500" height="279" /></a></p>
<p>And sometimes you just have to get creative. Lee has used off-the-wall products like &#8220;his and her beard scarves&#8221; and &#8220;brief jerky: edible male underwear&#8221; to compel would-be participants.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Measure influencer content performance</strong></p>
<p>How good was the content from each influencer? Did they share the content with their networks? Did they engage further with it? What were the sources of your traffic?</p>
<p>Evaluate your own performance as well. Did you make it easy for busy influencers to engage with the content by providing pre-written social messages, links, embed codes and status updates?</p>
<p>A thorough evaluation will reveal the campaign components you should keep, those you should tweak, and those you should toss entirely.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Develop an ongoing relationship</strong></p>
<p>There are several tactics marketers can use to strengthen relationships with their new content partners, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Offering feedback related to performance</li>
<li>Citing and promoting content partners in blog posts</li>
<li>Continuing engagement on social networks</li>
<li>Referring their expertise</li>
<li>Citing in contributed articles</li>
<li>Including in future projects</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, there was an excellent question in the Q &amp; A session which many marketers can relate to. Essentially, the question was, &#8220;Influencers probably won&#8217;t recognize me or my brand, how can I compel them to participate?&#8221;</p>
<p>To get the ball rolling, you may want to consider paying influencers to participate or providing some sort of preferential treatment. If you can convince one well-respected influencer to participate, you can leverage his or her participation in the rest of your outreach efforts. But the easiest (and most cost-effective) way to get influencers to participate is to clearly show how their participation will lead to a remarkable piece of content that provides value to to contributors as well as to your shared audience.</p>
<p>And there you have it: Influencer marketing in five fundamental steps. As Lee says, &#8220;You can do it, just make a plan, execute and iterate improvements.&#8221;</p>
<p>A big thanks to Joe Pulizzi and his team at the Content Marketing Institute for putting on one amazing event. I can&#8217;t wait for day two!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17321" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/joe-pulizzi-cmworld13-stage.jpg" alt="Joe Pulizzi" width="500" height="339" /></p>
<p>Content Marketing World is here! Over 2,500 attendees from over 50 countries have invaded Cleveland for the biggest, baddest and best content marketing conference on the planet. With nearly 200 speakers, including a keynote from famed actor, director and producer Kevin Spacey, there&#8217;s a lot to look forward to. Multiple tracks of sessions to attend, networking events and the exhibit hall can all seem a bit overwhelming.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s the thing about events: If you think you&#8217;re getting your money&#8217;s worth just by sitting in on a few sessions and mingling on the tradeshow floor, you&#8217;ve just touched the tip of the iceberg. We&#8217;ve been mastering the art of optimizing event attendance for maximum return for many years. Here are 5 ways you can use those insights to optimize your experience at Content Marketing World:</p>
<h3 style="color: #dd2c0e;">1. Win New Friends &amp; Influence People</h3>
<p style="color: #000000;">There is no substitute for a quality network. It takes time to grow a personal network and if you’re advocating for your company, then community development is also ongoing. Attending events online and off are essential for productive networking that can result in a variety of valuable outcomes including:</p>
<ul style="color: #000000;">
<li>Recruiting</li>
<li>Collecting competitive intelligence</li>
<li>Vendor and consultant sourcing</li>
<li>Partner sourcing</li>
<li>Prospecting for new customers.</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: #000000;">When you attend events, set goals for the kinds of contacts you want to make. Go so far as to make a list of people you want to meet if they’re particularly important to your goals. Initiate new connections with qualified prospects, marketing partners, vendors to outsource to and job candidates. At the same time, reinforce existing connections with contacts in your social networking pipeline. Each day, tally them up and plan how you will follow up. Follow on Twitter, connected on LinkedIn. Share useful tips, links and info that are relevant to your interactions with them. Give to get, but have a purpose and a goal for the connection.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Make sure you have goals and a purpose to your online and event networking. If you leave it to chance, you’re leaving a LOT of value on the table – for your competition.</p>
<h3 style="color: #dd2c0e;">2. Raise Your Content Marketing IQ.</h3>
<p style="color: #000000;">There are numerous benefits to attending conference sessions. The obvious is to hear smart speakers give presentations on important topics with useful tips. Sometimes speakers deliver on that promise and sometimes they don’t.</p>
<blockquote style="font-style: italic; color: #666666;">
<h2 style="color: #000000;">Don’t let bad conference content get in the way of getting smarter.</h2>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #000000;">Pay attention to how the speaker gives their presentation and observe how the audience responds. You might think the information isn’t useful to you, but if the attendees are leaning forward, writing notes and holding up their phones and ipads to take pictures of the presentation slides, then the speaker is connecting.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>You can benefit from understanding how the information is presented as much as from the actual tips</strong>. The format, sequence, design and presentation of information that connects is a model you can leverage for your own purposes: whether it’s speaking at a conference or event yourself or communicating and persuading people internally.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Planning your conference session attendance is essential</strong>. Think of how many sessions will you attend and how will you capture the information presented. Will you take notes on an iPad, laptop or (gasp) on paper? Will you take photos or video (where allowed)? Do you know where to get a copy of the speakers’ presentations? Introduce yourself to speakers and ask them a key question on video so you can review later and share with your team.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>When meeting new people, discuss the sessions with them</strong>. Compare notes – it’s a great way to network and to get other opinions. Before the conference, make a grid or a plan for which specific sessions you’ll be attending. Often times, there is not much time between sessions and the difference between getting a good seat and standing room only can be a matter of minutes and you might miss out on the session entirely because rooms can fill up.</p>
<h3 style="color: #dd2c0e;">3. Be A Content Creation (And Curation) Machine</h3>
<p style="color: #000000;">Content Marketing is hotter than ever but sourcing content is probably one of the biggest challenges for companies getting into the content publishing realm. The good news is that events from Twitter chats to webinars to keynote presentations and breakout sessions all provide opportunities to capture, curate and even create content. Some examples include:</p>
<ul style="color: #000000;">
<li><strong>Liveblogging</strong> – Transcribe what the speakers say word for word. Listen for key quotes or pieces of information and make a “list post” around a specific topic. Pre-write an article about the session topic and fill in stats and quotes from the speakers.</li>
<li><strong>Interviews</strong> – Reach out to speakers in advance and collect tips from their presentations as a way to help boost attendance to their session. Shoot video interviews of speakers or other smarties at the conference. Record podcast interviews with the same people. Capture single tips on video from a large number of people and compile into one video. Go to exhibitor booths and ask them for a 30 second pitch on video and compile them. Survey attendees on what they like best, tips they’ve heard, etc into a compilation video. With video, you might want to get sign-offs. Also, non-speakers may be reluctant.</li>
<li><strong>Journal</strong> – Keep notes and write a summary of key points from the day and publish like a journal entry. Link to other bloggers that are publishing liveblog posts at the same event.</li>
<li><strong>Curate</strong> – Use a tool like storify to curate the buzz of the conference. You don’t even need to be at the event to do this if a conference hashtag is used consistently.</li>
<li><strong>Track Your Own Buzz</strong> – If you are speaking, make sure someone from your team is tracking mentions of you, your company and topic on social streams like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Google+. Monitor any liveblogging of your presentations as well. Give people an incentive to liveblog your sessions too. If anyone liveblogs one of my presentations, I will send them a copy of <a style="color: #2966b3;" href="http://optimizebook.com/" target="_blank">Optimize</a> (for example). Curate those mentions into a roundup post on your company newsroom.</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: #000000;">Think about how you can leverage your conference experience to create new content for your company blog, articles, or process documentation. Set goals for how many content objects (blog posts, articles, videos, tweets, images) you’ll create each day. Organize what you will capture, with who and with what devices. Plan where you’ll publishing this content and when as well.  For curation, compile presentations posted to Slideshare, interviews others have posted to YouTube and liveblog posts covering interesting sessions – then add your own commentary as the icing on the cake.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The content you capture and create can supply a company blog with numerous posts and show clients, staff and prospective clients that you are on top of what’s happening in the industry.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17320" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/cmworld-audience-2013.jpg" alt="Optimize Content Marketing World" width="500" height="297" /></p>
<h3 style="color: #dd2c0e;">4. Transfer the Content Marketing Smarts to Your Company</h3>
<p style="color: #000000;">The explicit purpose of attending conferences is to hear industry experts share advice and insights into topics that your business can benefit from. Collecting actionable tips, statistics and other useful information form conferences to share with your team, clients and other groups in your organization can multiply the value of one person attending an event. If multiple people attend, the value can be even greater.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">To make knowledge transfer from conference content work, it’s important to create a process for information capture, synthesis and distribution.</p>
<ul style="color: #000000;">
<li><strong>Capture:</strong> Target specific speakers and sessions. Write questions you want answered and if the presentations do not contain those answers then pursue subject matter expert speakers to ask them directly. Capture information in text, audio, video and image. No one ever comes back from an event thinking they took too many photos. Maybe the wrong photos, but not to many. Also, be aware of conference policies on video and image capture.</li>
<li><strong>Synthesis</strong>: When you formulate questions, have specific applications for your business in mind. When you get the answers, filter the information in a way that will be practical and useful when it is shared – vs. all theoretical. Discuss the information and tips collected with fellow attendees to filter out what’s most useful.</li>
<li><strong>Distribution</strong>: Have a plan for how you will present the useful tactics, insights, statistics and case studies with your co-workers, clients and other interested parties.  You could write a report, you could create a presentation to give live or via webinar, you could compile video clips and images to narration. Individual tips could be saved on an internal knowledge base blog according to category. You could have a post-conference brown bag lunch discussion or a more formal presentation. There are many different options, but have them in mind before the conference to increase the likelihood they will actually happen and in an effective way.</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: #000000;">Knowing you will be required to present the information you are gaining at a conference with the team back at the office can helps you focus on takeaways and practical interpretations of what’s being presented, instead of what you don’t like or the lacking presentation skills of the presenter.</p>
<h3 style="color: #dd2c0e;">5. Maximize and Optimize Events &#8211; Before, During and After</h3>
<p style="color: #000000;">For nearly all events, I like to break things up into pre-event, during and after.  You could actually further distinguish near-after and long-after as well as a recurring component if the event is held at regular intervals, like many are on an annual basis.  Many conference speakers rely on the event to do the marketing. That’s a big fail.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Here are a few tips before, during and after the event to gain more attendees, more media coverage and post-event value:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Before the event:</strong></p>
<ul style="color: #000000;">
<li>Write headlines, descriptions, tags and make trackable short URLs</li>
<li>Pre-write tweets, updates and decide on a hashtag</li>
<li>Submit your session to event listing sites, create events on Facebook and LinkedIn</li>
<li>Create a contest or buzz around your presentation to inspire others to tell their networks</li>
<li>Issue an optimized press release</li>
<li>Schedule interviews with media attending the event and/or local media</li>
<li>Connect with other speakers in advance</li>
<li>Create a teaser for your presentation</li>
<li>Announce your event attendance through email and your social channels</li>
<li>When you meet people before your presentation, don’t be shy about sharing when you are speaking</li>
<li>Create a check-in notice on Foursquare inviting people to attend your session</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>During the event:</strong></p>
<ul style="color: #000000;">
<li>Create content the audience can participate with. I like to take photos of the audience and post to our Facebook page so they can tag themselves.</li>
<li>Use tweetable, shareable content in your presentation</li>
<li>Give something away to motivate desired behaviors like asking questions</li>
<li>Always include a report or fulfillment piece in your thank you page</li>
<li>Have someone on your team monitoring tweets and buzz during your presentation. Interact as appropriate</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>After the event:</strong></p>
<ul style="color: #000000;">
<li>Curate buzz about the presentation into a blog post and/or newsroom post</li>
<li>Follow up on questions asked and fulfillment deliverables</li>
<li>Connect with new contacts through appropriate social channels</li>
<li>Thank the conference for having you</li>
<li>If you were on a panel, thank the panelists and moderator</li>
<li>Thank any livebloggers that covered your session</li>
<li>Use media coverage from the event in your newsroom, corporate email and other communications</li>
<li>Follow up!!!!!</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: #000000;">As you can see, there are many ways to extend and optimize the value of business conference attendance. Try one or two of these tips for your next event and share how it turned out. Or, if you’ve found even more ways to get extra value from conference attendance, let us know.</p>

I almost forgot the discussion was about marketing because of how witty and funny Scott is. He hits the nail on the head with the point that, while being personable on social media is crucial, it shouldn&#8217;t dwarf the quality of your product.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>2PartsAnalog</strong> also commented, &#8220;This article brings to light the need for the organic factor to be present in the marketing process. The human factor is the best element in the marketing factor.&#8221;</p>
<p>And <strong>Kostas Chiotis</strong> added, &#8220;Another great interview Lee. I love Scott&#8217;s analogy of sending a Mannequin to network for you! I feel the same way about automated SMM &#8211; If you genuinely do not have time then hire someone who understands your brand enough to do it for you!&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17310" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Heidi-Cohen-interview.jpg" alt="Heidi Cohen" width="500" height="300" /></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Whether you&#8217;ve been in the digital and content marketing game for just a few years, or since before the expression &#8220;content marketing&#8221; was popular, the tools exist for bright minds to create a brand and communicate their thought leadership. Powered with experience, great ideas and a passion for knowledge attainment and sharing, people like Heidi Cohen have walked the talk with content marketing by using content to advance their position in the digital marketing world.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">As the President of Riverside Marketing Strategies and the Chief Content Officer of the Actionable Marketing Guide, <a href="http://twitter.com/heidicohen" target="_blank">Heidi Cohen</a>&#8216;s content marketing experience ranges from being a long time direct marketer for companies like The Economist, a columnist at ClickZ for many years, and past adjunct professor in the Masters in Integrated Marketing program at NYU. Based in New York City, Heidi publishes a very popular blog on all things marketing: <a href="http://heidicohen.com/" target="_blank">Actionable Marketing Guide.</a></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">In this pre <a style="color: #2966b3;" href="http://tprk.us/cmworld14i" target="_blank">Content Marketing World</a> interview, Heidi covers all the content marketing bases, from strategy to audience to content to ROI. She even shares business lessons from a few favorite childhood stories.</p>
<p><strong>How important is it for a company to have a content marketing strategy defined before asking internally for budget or engaging an outside consultant? Can experimentation lead to strategy or is a hybrid approach more practical?</strong></p>
<p>Content marketing like social media should NOT be something a business does on the side because it’s in vogue.</p>
<p>A company considering taking advantage of content marketing to achieve its business goals should start by examining its business objectives, target audience, and offering to understand where they have gaps in their marketing plans. This enables them to create specific pieces of content.</p>
<p>Before diving into content marketing, a business should know what’s working and what isn’t or they may wind up reinventing the wheel.</p>
<p>For companies that don’t understand what’s happening to their business or how the market has evolved, it’s useful to bring in an outside consultant to guide them.</p>
<p>Ideally a content marketing plan should come from within your business since it’s core to your strategy and needs to be yours.</p>
<p><strong>What are some ways you can use audience insights to inform your content planning and promotion?</strong></p>
<p>Take the time to understand your target audience including your prospects, customers, influencers, end-users and fans. Use a combination of quantitative and qualitative information. Ideally, this should be based on past purchase behavior and customer interactions.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Create a set of <a href="http://heidicohen.com/persona-definition-essential-marketing-persona-attributes/">marketing personae</a></strong> so that your content speaks directly to your market.</li>
<li><strong>Develop content</strong> that your audience actively seeks.</li>
<li><strong>Place and distribute your content</strong> based on your audience’s media consumption habits and their device usage.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Visuals in content marketing are increasingly popular but how important are they really? Is this the beginning of the end of text or just a phase?</strong></p>
<p>The use of images and visuals is <em>NOT</em> new. It dates back to the cave drawings. Viewing visual content is built into our DNA.</p>
<p><strong>The take-away for content marketers:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Employ a variety of forms of visual content to boost your content’s ability to attract the maximum audience.  </strong>There’s a lot of content out there. Use every technique you can to break through!!!</p>
<p>As for text, don’t write it off too quickly. Language and writing have evolved over centuries, I don’t think that they’re disappearing any time soon. The proof: Smartphone ownership and use. They’ve grown exponentially recently<em> BUT</em> text and email are among the most popular functions after social media.</p>
<p><strong>The take-away for content marketers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do as your mother taught you! <em>“Use your words”</em> to explain and help your target audience to understand you. </strong>Incorporate them into <a href="http://heidicohen.com/5-basic-content-types-customers-need/">the 5 basic content types</a> your prospects need and seek.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17312" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/5-types-of-food1.jpg" alt="Content Types" width="500" height="398" /></p>
<p>BTW – Note how I used both images and text to convey my point and get your attention?</p>
<p><strong>Is Content Marketing ROI really that hard? What are you doing to measure content marketing performance?</strong></p>
<p>Tracking content marketing ROI is only difficult because, despite the goal of increasing profitability, many businesses don’t think about it until after they’ve created and distributed their content. As a result, measuring results are an afterthought.</p>
<p>To effectively understand content marketing and its contribution to your business, select your metrics after you determine your business goals. Then incorporate appropriate calls-to-action and related landing pages. (NOTE: These are not one-size-fits-all.)</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17314" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/alice-crown.jpg" alt="Alice in Wonderland Crown" width="275" height="417" /></p>
<p><strong>In the spirit of the Content Marketing in Wonderland (Alice) theme of the #CMWorld eBook series, what was your favorite story from childhood? Any lessons in it for business or marketing today?</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>I had 2 childhood favorites:</p>
<p><em>Le Petit Prince</em> by  Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</p>
<p>The fox says to the Little Prince, “You become responsible forever for what you’ve tamed. You’re responsible for your rose.”</p>
<p>This was one of the first books I read in French and I loved the drawings. It’s a book of adult lessons parading as a child’s book.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing take-away:</strong> As marketers, we have a responsibility for our customers. It’s a promise we make. This goes back to the <a href="http://heidicohen.com/marketing-the-4-moments-of-truth-chart/">4 Moments of Truth</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17313" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Marketing-4-Moments-of-Truth.jpg" alt="Marketing Moments of Truth" width="512" height="339" /></p>
<p><em>Harriet The Spy</em> by Louise Fitzhugh</p>
<p>I loved this book. Probably because I wanted to live in Manhattan not its suburbs! Or maybe because my dad had high security clearance in World War II and worked on secret stuff he never talked about.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing take-away:</strong> You always need to keep tabs on what’s happening around you. Keep up with changes in the environment (including styles, politics, and economics), transformations in technology, and the evolution of competitors. It’s not just your direct competitors. Most businesses do that. Consider the broader set of major players and indirect competitors.</p>
<p>By observing others, you’ll start to walk in your customers’ shoes and see your offering from their perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Thanks Heidi!</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-17306 size-full" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/influencer-content-grow-business1.jpg" alt="influencer content marketing" width="500" height="322" /></p>
<p>A never ending stream of high quality content simply isn&#8217;t sustainable for most organizations. But what if Marketers could tap into a rich source of content optimized for engagement, sharing and action?</p>
<p>This is the promise of co-created content and participation marketing. Not limited to influencers, participation marketing is to partner with others to create content that the community they are a part of would find useful. These co-creation partners might be existing customers, industry influentials, other connected businesses and individuals or even prospective customers.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>A brandividual is popular. An influencer is effective at creating popularity.</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>While many see influencer marketing as a way to simply gain entry to an influencer&#8217;s network, there are many more dimensions to it than that. We&#8217;ve been experimenting with numerous influencer content projects over the past 3 years and have developed some exciting strategies and processes around influencer engagement and content co-creation.</p>
<p>Recently, Ann Handley of MarketingProfs (and Author of the new book, <a href="http://annhandley.com/everybodywrites/" target="_blank">Everybody Writes</a>) interviewed me on this topic for her column in <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/236329" target="_blank">Entrepreneur Magazine</a> &#8220;4 Ways to Get Influencers to Spread Your Brand&#8217;s Message&#8221;.</p>
<p>Here is my Q and A prep for the interview offering insights into everything from defining what an influencer is to the top things to avoid:</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;">How should a company define &#8220;influencer&#8221;? Are there benchmarks and best practices they might consider?</span></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/236329" target="_blank"><img class="alignright wp-image-17303 size-full" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/entrepreneur-magazine-september-2014.jpg" alt="Entrepreneur Magazine" width="250" height="333" hspace="5" /></a>An influencer has subject matter authority, credibility amongst a network and most importantly, the ability to affect actions amongst the network. The most common mistake businesses make with influencers is to qualify them based purely on network size (fans, friends and followers) and affinity to a certain industry or area of interest. Without the ability to affect the way a network thinks and how they act, an influencer isn’t really influencing anyone. They’re just a “brandividual”.</p>
<p>Influencers can be people at large in an industry, they could be inside a company as subject matter experts or even amongst customers. Influencer relationships often include a value exchange of some kind and it’s up to the company and influencer to decide whether that’s an exchange of information or visibility or compensation.</p>
<p>Think about what you want the influencer to do, how will their involvement help your company reach a particular business goal? What will an ongoing relationship with influencers mean to your marketing and reputation?</p>
<p>Best practices for working with influencers includes a process of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identification</li>
<li>Qualification</li>
<li>Engagement</li>
<li>Recruitment</li>
<li>Implementation</li>
<li>Amplification</li>
<li>Feedback &amp; Optimization</li>
<li>Ongoing Relationship</li>
</ul>
<p>As companies become more influential themselves, they need to look in both directions. What I mean is, beyond picking the most popular, influential people is to identify up and coming influencers. Working with an established influencer makes them your friend for a day. Helping upcoming talent become influential makes them a friend for life.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;">What are some tools you can use to find influencers in your industry?</span></h3>
<p>It’s often useful to start with executives, marketing, communications and product managers to develop a list of topical expertise and even nominations of specific individuals. Attending industry events can reveal influencers who are speaking and meeting them in person can initiate a relationship.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14905" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/social-media-predictions-2013.jpg" alt="Social Media Predictions 2013" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p>For example, working with Connie Bensen and Dell’s Social Media Predictions project, we took a seed list of influencers from marketing staff at Dell and expanded upon it using tools to find other influencers like those initially identified. That eBook has had well over 150,000 views and thousands of shares on SlideShare alone.</p>
<p>Those characterizations will be useful with influencer discovery tools like <a href="http://followerwonk.com" target="_blank">Followerwonk</a> or <a href="http://www.getlittlebird.com/" target="_blank">Little Bird</a> which both focus on Twitter. There are also robust paid tools like <a href="http://traackr.com/" target="_blank">Traackr</a>, <a href="http://buzzsumo.com/" target="_blank">BuzzSumo</a> or <a href="http://www.grouphigh.com/" target="_blank">GroupHigh</a>.</p>
<p>After you use a tool to identify influencers for each topic, then you can bring that list back to your internal subject matter experts to manually review and filter. Of course, no influencer discovery tool is perfect. Correlation amongst multiple tools and sources might take more time, but it&#8217;s a best practice for distinguishing between brandividuals and effective influencers.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;">What&#8217;s the key to getting influencers to share your content for you?</span></h3>
<p><strong>First, create content worth sharing</strong>. Topics that address issues that are important to the influencer will get your foot in the door and useful, visually compelling content will inspire them to open that door and share. Reaching out blindly and asking to share doesn’t work as well as having a connection first and then asking.</p>
<p><strong>Second, let the ego do the talking</strong>. Content that includes an influencer&#8217;s contribution will probably get shared even more. Because let’s face it, people love to see themselves get recognized. Better yet, ask them to participate in the creation of the content. However, when mentioning influencers in content it’s essential that it be credible, high quality and creative. Most influencers have caught on to the tactic of simply mentioning famous industry people just to get them to share. There must be value created that inspires and earns the share.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-16372" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/LinkedIn-Marketing-eBook_new-300x167.jpg" alt="LinkedIn Marketing Soluitions eBook" width="300" height="167" /></p>
<p>When we helped Jason Miller and Deanna Lazzaroni at LinkedIn create The Sophisticated Marketer’s Guide to LinkedIn, we identified and engaged with influencers best known as LinkedIn and B2B marketing experts. Then we asked them to share their best tips for marketing on LinkedIn which were included in the eBook along with advice from LinkedIn Marketing Solutions. The eBook has been shared thousands of times generating millions in new business. In fact, the ROI on this project is at 21,000% You read that right! We&#8217;re now helping LinkedIn create a follow up guide focused on Thought Leadership.</p>
<p><strong>Third, make it fun and easy.</strong> When emailing an ask, make it funny or at least clever and especially easy for the influencer to share. Capture their attention, succinctly explain what it is and what you want them to do. Then offer pre-written social share text that’s even personalized just for them. You may even create a resource page with images and other share options for them to use.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/toprank/content-marketing-roi-ebook-cmworld" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17305" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/content-marketing-roi-ebook-cover-300.jpg" alt="content marketing roi ebook" width="300" height="226" /></a></p>
<p>When we create conference eBooks for events like Content Marketing World or MarketingProfs B2B Forum, we send image previews of the influencer’s page in the eBook along with prewritten tweets to give them a quick view of what the thing is and an easy way to schedule social shares.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus</strong> &#8211; but not my favorite. Pay them. Either compensate the influencer with information, with promotion or with compensation to share your content. Once you start down this road, it’s pretty difficult to get off, so plan for continued compensation once you start.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;">Does influencer outreach have to be face-to-face, ideally? Or does it work online?</span></h3>
<p>Influencer outreach can begin on or offline but I believe both are essential. A common scenario involves meeting an influencer in person at an event, connecting on LinkedIn and following up with an invite to work together.</p>
<p>Another would be to recognize influencers on a list, connect on Twitter, engage online and when a face to face opportunity becomes available, make a connection in person. There is no substitute for face to face, but many of our influencer relationships are only online.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;">If you give influencers something cool for free, is it okay to expect them to talk about the cool free thing?</span></h3>
<p>An experienced influencer will understand the implied value exchange, but even with them, I’d recommend that expectations be communicated. “We know you love cycling and we’d love to send you a pair of our new cycling sunglasses to try out. Maybe even rave about! (but only if you love love them of course). That sort of thing.</p>
<p>If the cool free thing is highly relevant, creative or unique, there’s an equally high chance they will talk about it online and off. But there are no guarantees. So communication is key.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;">What&#8217;s the biggest mistake a business makes in trying to engage influencers?</span></h3>
<p>Presumptive, high expectation pitches with no romance and little upside for the influencer. It’s the equivalent of a stranger approaching you and saying, &#8220;Let’s get married”.</p>
<p>The time to start creating relationships with influencers is long before you actually need them. If a company is thinking that working with influencers is even a remote possibility, they should start identifying, qualifying and engaging with them now. That way, when the time comes to work together on a project, there’s already some familiarity and credibility before “the ask”.</p>

<p>Customer acquisition without marketing. Is that even possible in the business to business world? Not only is it possible, it&#8217;s what&#8217;s next.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a business to business (B2B) marketer, you&#8217;ve undoubtedly seen the &#8220;be human&#8221; and H2H meme. Funny thing is, humans have always been behind all those business product and service purchases. What&#8217;s not so funny are the continued fails in how B2B companies communicate, the experiences they create for business buyers and the unrealized marketing power of delivering awesome.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time to shine a light on how B2B marketers can elevate their &#8220;human&#8221; approach to buyers and one of the best people to do that is <a href="http://www.unmarketing.com/about/" target="_blank">Scott Stratten</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118943007" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-17299" src="http://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/unselling-scottstratten.png" alt="UnSelling" width="263" height="389" hspace="5" /></a>Scott is the president of <a href="http://www.unmarketing.com/" target="_blank">UnMarketing</a>. He ran his &#8220;UnAgency&#8221; for nearly a decade before solely focusing on speaking at events for companies like PepsiCo, Adobe, Red Cross, Hard Rock Cafe, Cirque du Soleil, Saks Fifth Avenue, Deloitte, and Fidelity Investments on social media and relationship marketing. Named a top social media influencer by Forbes, the <a href="https://twitter.com/unmarketing" target="_blank">Tweeple</a> love Scott with over 160,000 people following his daily rantings. He&#8217;s also written three best-selling books including QR Codes Kill Kittens and his newest book: <a href="http://unmarketing.com/unselling/" target="_blank">UnSelling</a>.</p>
<p>In anticipation of the upcoming MarketingProfs <a href="http://mprofs.com/b2b14ebk" target="_blank">B2B Forum</a> conference (Oct 8-10 in Boston) where the emphasis is on &#8220;Marketing for What Comes Next&#8221;, this interview with Scott covers everything from customer experience to brand marketing fails to what Scott really thinks about Tumblr. It&#8217;s a great preview of his smarts and humor. Check it out:</p>
<p><strong>Who is Scott Stratten? Which came first, the business smarts or the funny?</strong></p>
<p>Business smarts. When I was 13, I had convinced my friends to clean up the dog poop in our backyard, since my mom said we couldn’t play road hockey until it was done. She said that was the point she knew I’d be an entrepreneur. Or a conman. I can’t remember, it was a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>I’ve always heard the best marketing investment a company can make is in their product. Is that true? Or is it an investment in customer experience?</strong></p>
<p>I’m the first person to preach about customer experience, but if your product is terrible, I don’t care if you’re the greatest customer/community believer in the world, it won’t help. We always talk about the importance of social media, of being where the customer conversation is, but we need to tend to our own home first.</p>
<p>I once had a woman in Istanbul stand up after a talk I gave and asked “We have a lot of people on Twitter complaining about our product. How do we stop them?” That’s the problem. If people are angry on Twitter, you don’t have a social media problem, you have a problem with your product.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the first thing most companies need to “unlearn” about marketing that doesn’t harm any kittens?</strong></p>
<p>They really need to stop mannequin networking. Setting up shop online, in social media, and only broadcasting and scheduling/automating. It’s like sending a mannequin to a networking event. Sure, you’re “there” but you’re just not there.</p>
<p><strong>Consumers are empowered to publish like never before. Does that make them competitors to brands or potential marketing partners?</strong></p>
<p>What it comes down to is transparency in marketing, that’s where the consumer comes in. Marketing is no longer about what brand message the company wants to put out, it’s what the customer thinks. Good or bad. You don’t define your brand. If you want to know what your brand statement is, ask a customer.</p>
<p>People trust reviews more than commercials, by a huge margin. There’s a reason for that. I don’t stay somewhere without checking TripAdvisor. I don’t eat somewhere without looking at Yelp. Corporations like to talk about being transparent, but consumers are transparent when they talk.</p>
<p><strong>Two brand marketing fails, go!</strong></p>
<p>Nothing like leveraging the most successful fundraising event in history to take a shot at your competitors:</p>

<p>Insert here any brand that used Robin Williams suicide as a PR opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>What brand is your poster child for doing it right?</strong></p>
<p>WestJet airlines in Canada. Great people, great social, great across the board. We highlighted them in the new book, UnSelling, and while I was going over the chapter on a flight with them, one of their VP’s boarded the plane, introduced himself to the flight attendant and rolled up his sleeves and helped with the drink service. It was perfect.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s play social media word association. What’s the first thing that pops into your mind when I say:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Facebook</strong> – People from high school I never liked.<br />
<strong>Vine</strong> – Makes my son cackle with glee when he watches videos. Who knew?<br />
<strong>LinkedIn</strong> – People I use to work with I never liked.<br />
<strong>Twitter</strong> – People I used to like, but now they schedule all their tweets.<br />
<strong>Google+</strong> – Lol<br />
<strong>Snapchat</strong> – Something I’m not cool enough to use. Kids these days.<br />
<strong>YouTube</strong> – The TV of today.<br />
<strong>Instagram</strong> – Pics of food I never liked.<br />
<strong>Pinterest</strong> – Great site, ruined by marketers.<br />
<strong>MySpace</strong> – Tom<br />
<strong>Tumblr</strong> – Great space being ruined by Yahoo!</p>
<p><strong>Your keynote title at <a href="http://mprofs.com/b2b14ebk" target="_blank">MarketingProfs B2B Forum</a> is, “Marketing for What Comes Next. Expect the Unexpected&#8221; can you share a few preview concepts?</strong></p>
<p>It’s Unexpected. Why would I tell you? Sheesh.</p>

<p><strong> I am so happy you have become a member of the esteemed and mysterious “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/marketerswithbeards/" target="_blank">Marketers with Beards</a>” Facebook group. I would like to name you honorary Grand Puba. Speech</strong>?</p>
<p>I’ve been waiting for this moment since I sprouted my first chin hair. It is an honour and a privilege to be along my fellow bearded men (and women).</p>
<p><strong>Thanks Scott!</strong></p>

He&#8217;ll be giving the opening keynote: &#8220;Marketing for What Comes Next. Expect the Unexpected&#8221;.</p>
<p>If you are a B2B marketer, I can&#8217;t recommend the B2B Forum enough. It&#8217;s a conference where you can actually get to know other attendees dealing with the same kinds of issues in B2B marketing that you are. You&#8217;ll also be able to connect with over 60 B2B marketing industry experts giving presentations and one to one consulting. Get Boston Oct 8-10 for MarketingProfs B2B Forum on your calendar, I know I am!</p>

<p>In the world of content marketing, curation plays an instrumental role for companies that want to become a single source destination for industry news and information related to their area of expertise. Interest in curation has grown significantly and to meet demand, a number of software companies have emerged.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.curata.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Curata</a> is one of the leaders in the content curation and content marketing software space, lead by <a href="https://twitter.com/TweetsFromPawan" target="_blank">Pawan Deshpande</a>.</p>
<p>As the founder and CEO of Curata, Pawan is responsible for the company&#8217;s vision, management and advanced development initiatives. His work at Curata has been recognized through the 2010 Boston Business Journal&#8217;s 40 under 40 Award, and through the Massachusetts Technology Leadership Council&#8217;s 2012 Sales &amp; Marketing Technology of the Year Award. Before founding Curata, he held software engineering positions at Microsoft, Google.</p>
<p>In this pre <a href="http://tprk.us/cmworld14i" target="_blank">Content Marketing World</a> interview, Pawan talks about how to develop a content marketing strategy, gives tips on how to leverage insights about your target audience and provides some useful perspective on content marketing ROI.</p>
<p><strong>How important is it for a company to have a content marketing strategy defined before asking internally for budget or engaging an outside consultant? Can experimentation lead to strategy or is a hybrid approach more practical?</strong></p>
<p>Developing a content marketing strategy should be the first course of action prior to expending resources. For example, prior to identifying the type and format of content needed, it is important to understand:</p>
<p>1) Your <strong>overall content marketing objectives</strong>;</p>
<p>2) Who <strong>your target audience</strong> is (segments, personas);</p>
<p>3) What their <strong>greatest pain points</strong> are, including what will be of value to them. This insight can then be used to develop longer term content campaigns with “heavier” formats (e.g., ebooks) that can be atomized into smaller, more digestible deliverables.</p>
<p>In parallel, ~25% of your content marketing output should be produced in a more sporadic fashion with less strategic direction.  This creates room for more event-driven content as well as offering greater opportunity for experimentation.</p>
<p><strong>What are some ways you can use audience insights to inform your content planning and promotion?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Develop useful content:</strong>  There’s no better way to understand the pain points and needs of your audience than to directly ask them. (e.g., interviews, surveys, casual conversations) Develop content based on these needs that will be of use to them, regardless of the fact that it may not have anything to do with your product offering.</p>
<p><strong>Speak their language:</strong>  Don’t only understand what’s important to your audience, but learn what type of content is most relevant to their company, job and career. For example, Verne Global developed a curated microsite focused specifically on <a href="http://www.automotiveitnews.org/">Automotive IT News</a> to bring valuable content to an IT professionals in the automotive industry.</p>
<p><strong>Learn from experience:</strong> Content marketing strategy should be an iterative process.  Put in place a comprehensive measurement strategy to understand what types of content, format and channels are most successful or even least successful.  A continuous feedback loop of content marketing analytics that informs your strategy will assure that you learn from past mistakes and successes.</p>
<p><strong>Visuals in content marketing are increasingly popular but how important are they really? Is this the beginning of the end of text or just a phase?</strong></p>
<p>As more and more companies employ content marketing, the costs of creating content that stands out continue to increase.  In the earlier days, a short form blog post with a great idea was often sufficient to get attention. These days it’s harder to differentiate from everyone without exerting more effort.  Because of this, the most successful content formats are currently long form blog posts, ebooks and infographics.  In the future, content marketers will have to differentiate even further by investing in more sophisticated formats such as interactive content, and other forms of visual media.</p>
<p>While the costs for marketers will increase, it will ultimately result in a better experience for content consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Is Content Marketing ROI really that hard? What are you doing to measure content marketing performance?</strong></p>
<p>Content marketing has <a href="http://www.curata.com/blog/content-marketing-history-infographic/">come a long way</a> in the past few years, and there are now definite content marketing metrics along with technologies that can help to quantify the return on content marketing investment. However, both organizational and technical silos will need to be broken down in order to tap into the varying sources of information to get to this elusive ROI.</p>
<p>At Curata we have begun to fully integrate our content management process with both marketing and sales automation platforms to determine the impact of our content on pipeline and revenue. We no longer measure the success of content solely based on “engagement”, social shares or pageviews.  While these are important parts of the equation, we also evaluate our efforts on their influence on leads and revenue.</p>

<p><strong>In the spirit of the Content Marketing in Wonderland (Alice) theme of the #CMWorld eBook series, what was your favorite story from childhood? Any lessons in it for business or marketing today? </strong></p>
<p>Growing up, one of my favorite stories was The Very Hungry Caterpillar by Eric Carle. Here are a few ways it applies to content marketing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quality over Quantity:</strong> At first, the very hungry caterpillar consumes too much food, eating everything from a lollipop to a piece of pie. After some time, the caterpillar decides to eat higher quality food (a leaf) and he then transforms into a butterfly. Similarly, marketers should focus on producing high quality, relevant content, instead of a high quantity.</li>
<li><strong>Digestible Content:</strong> The caterpillar learned that the best food was very digestible and easy to break down. Marketers should create content with similar characteristics so that more readers are able to consume it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Thank you Pawan.</strong> Also, thank you to <a href="http://www.curata.com" target="_blank">Curata</a> for sponsoring the Content Marketing World conference eBook series we&#8217;ve been publishing and promoting this month!</p>

<h3>Understand Why Before ROI with Content Marketing</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>The rush towards the content marketing bandwagon can seem as chaotic and nonsensical as most of the adventures of Alice in Wonderland. There are Cheshire Cats offering ambiguous advice and Red Queen business managers demanding results now or, &#8220;off with their heads!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>There is no satisfaction from investing in creating more content if the purpose (or porpoise) is not clear.</strong> This is why &#8220;the why&#8221; of content marketing is so important.  <a href="http://twitter.com/joepulizzi" target="_blank">Joe Pulizzi</a> makes this quite clear with his recommendations in the <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2014/08/content-marketing-roi-ebook/">Content Marketing ROI eBook</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>To see if you’re on the right path, use the Why? Exercise:</p>
<p>Put “Why?” at the top of a piece of paper.<br />
List all the different channels you are creating content for (e.g. your blog, website, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn) down the left side of the page.<br />
List “Why” you’re creating content for that channel. (The Why? needs to be either sales, savings or customer retention/loyalty.)</p>
<p>We’ve performed this exercise with dozens of billion-dollar brands. Not once has one of these brands had the Why? for every one of the channels for which they create content.</p>
<p>This is a problem, and one you can fix.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Indeed you can.</strong> Below we have an infographic created by Christie Anderson from TopRank, citing the 10 content marketing ROI experts featured in the <a href="http://tprk.us/cmroi14" target="_blank">Showing Real ROI for Your Content Marketing eBook</a>. They include Nicole Smith, Joe Pulizzi, Jay Acunzo, JoAnn Sciarrino, Michael Brenner, Andrew Davis, Julie Fleischer, Robert Rose, Pawan Deshpande and Ardath Albee &#8211; a true &#8220;A-List&#8221; of content marketing smarties.</p>
<p>A combination of useful and entertaining, &#8220;infotaining&#8221; as I like to call it, this infographic and eBook draw upon a select group of speakers that will be presenting at this year&#8217;s <a href="http://tprk.us/cmworld14i" target="_blank">Content Marketing World conference</a>. Here are some of their &#8220;tweetable tips&#8221;:</p>
<p><strong>Joe Pulizzi, CEO at Content Marketing Institute</strong><br />
&#8220;Skip analytics reports for your CMO. Instead, focus measurement reporting on performance: sales, cost savings, and customer retention.&#8221; @joepulizzi <a href="http://ctt.ec/7R0Er" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tweet this</a></p>
<p><strong>Julie Fleischer, Director, Data + Content + Media at Kraft Foods </strong><br />
&#8220;Without attributable sales results, you must get creative measuring content ROI through cost savings, marketing efficiency, and specialized insights.&#8221; @jfly <a href="http://ctt.ec/5f15c" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tweet this</a></p>
<p><strong>Michael Brenner, Head of Strategy at NewsCred </strong><br />
&#8220;Content marketing is the thing that will save marketing itself, because it works. Track costs, measure results &amp; trace those metrics back to business value.&#8221; @BrennerMichael <a href="http://ctt.ec/fH5p7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tweet this</a></p>
<p><strong>Nicole Smith, Managing Editor, Tech Page One at Dell </strong><br />
&#8220;&#8216;Get real&#8217; with content by surveying your audience, through usability testing, listening socially &amp; folding that data into your content strategy.&#8221; @NicoleSatDell <a href="http://ctt.ec/P0lNx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tweet this</a></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Davis, Author at Brandscaping and Keynote Speaker</strong><br />
&#8220;The more you focus on measuring market size vs. market share, the more revenue you’ll generate. Create content to grow your entire market.&#8221; @TPLDrew <a href="http://ctt.ec/ar3Nb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tweet this</a></p>
<p><strong>Ardath Albee, CEO &amp; B2B Marketing Strategist at Marketing Interactions </strong><br />
&#8220;Determining ROI in the B2B space takes creativity. Measure content relevance to boost performance &amp; manage content quality to increase sales follow through.&#8221; @ardath421 <a href="http://ctt.ec/GCAJE" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tweet this</a></p>
<p><strong>Robert Rose, Chief Strategy Officer at Content Marketing Institute </strong><br />
&#8220;Traditional ROI measures are flawed. Focus on measuring content, vs. teams, both quality and quantity, and see ROI as progress, not a destination.&#8221; @Robert_Rose <a href="http://ctt.ec/jeUZN" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tweet this</a></p>
<p><strong>Pawan Deshpande, CEO at Curata </strong><br />
&#8220;To gain insight for more effective content marketing strategy, focus on 3 metrics: performance, operations &amp; ROI.&#8221; @tweetsfrompawan <a href="http://ctt.ec/3W8dS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tweet this</a></p>
