		<title>Playing the Field: The Sport of Today’s Venture Capital for Innovation</title>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Let him who would enjoy a good future waste none of his present.&#8221;&#160;Those words, from early 20th century investor Roger Babson, are an accurate reflection of the watchful VC investing we&#8217;ve seen in the last quarter. VCs are hesitant to place big bets on the untested start-up, often holding back until the later stage financing [&#8230;]</p>

		<title>In Forza Horizon 2, Computers Finally Drive as Crazy as Humans</title>
		<description><![CDATA[<p><em>Forza Horizon 2</em>, available for Xbox One on September 30, is different from last year’s <em>Forza 5</em>, which aims to offer an exact reproduction of real-world racing. Instead of being limited to tracks, <em>Horizon 2</em> drivers have access to a huge chunk of southern France and Italy, from Nice to Castelletto (complete with stunning visuals and realistic weather). Even better, unlike the original, Colorado-based <em>Forza Horizon</em>, drivers aren't limited to roadways. It’s like <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>: You can go nearly anywhere. Forests, hay fields, off-road trails, and pedestrian walkways are all accessible.</p>

		<title>This Neuromancer-Inspired Music Video Is Actually a Videogame</title>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>Groundislava's new album is, essentially, about one man's downfall after he loses the girl he loves in a virtual realm. (It's also, not surprisingly, an homage to William Gibson's <em>Neuromancer</em>.) Seems like a theme that lends itself to slam-dunk music video ideas, right? Whip up a concept that looks like <em>Blade Runner</em> or <em>Tron</em>, hit Record, and <em>ta-da!</em>: instant Vimeo hit. Groundislava&#8212;aka Jasper Patterson&#8212;took it a little further: He made the video a world you can actually play in. </p>
