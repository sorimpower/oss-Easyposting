				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a world of multiple devices, online ubiquity, and cloud storage, the security of your personal content—email, documents, and photos—is more important than ever. In addition to the behind-the-scenes work we do to keep your Outlook.com account secure, we’ve made a list of what we think are the top five things that <em>you</em> can do, to help keep your account as secure as possible:</p>
<h3>1. Use a strong password and change it often</h3>
<p>A strong password is one that is not easy to guess. Our advice is to make your password a combination of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols. We also recommend that you change it often, just in case someone manages to guess it. We recommend changing it every two months, and when you do, it should not be in any sort of pattern. For example, don’t simply change your password from “heLLo.1” to “heLLo.2”.</p>
<h3>2. Use different passwords for each online account</h3>
<p>We all use multiple services—be that Facebook, Twitter, Xbox Live, eBay etc. To keep all of your accounts more secure, we recommend using a different password for each. This means that if someone manages to guess your password for one service, the others are still secure.</p>
<h3>3. Set up two-step verification</h3>
<p>Outlook.com offers two-step verification, an optional extra layer of security on your account. You should enable this if you would like to make your account as secure as possible.</p>
<p>Two-step verification helps protect your Outlook.com account by making it more difficult for a hacker to sign in, <em>even</em> if they’ve somehow learned your password. When you enable two-step verification, you’ll see an extra page every time you sign in on a new or unfamiliar device. The extra page prompts you to enter a security code, which we’ll send to your phone or your alternative email address. You can also obtain one through an authenticator app on your smartphone (the official Microsoft authenticator can be found on <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/authenticator/e7994dbc-2336-4950-91ba-ca22d653759b">Windows Phone</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.msa.authenticator">Android</a>).</p>
<p>Watch this video to learn how to set up two-step verification:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/o7aVPU8-kKw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h3>4. Never give out your password or write it down</h3>
<p>This may sound obvious, but you should be the only person to know your password. Be very aware of ‘phishing scams’ —where someone tries to convince you to provide your account details by acting as a representative for your email service. This could be disguised as a phone call or an email. Just remember that Microsoft will never ask you to provide your password by email or over the phone.</p>
<h3>5. Make sure your alternative email address and phone number is up to date</h3>
<p>We use your alternative email address and phone number to send you a verification code if you forget your password, suspect your account has been hacked, or we notice your account has been logged in from an unusual location. By keeping this information up to date, it’s easier for us to verify that it’s really you trying to log in, making your account more secure.</p>
<p>You may have your own tips for how you keep your account secure. If you have any, we’d love to hear them—you can let us know by commenting below, or tweeting @Outlook.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Jared Spataro is the general manager of Enterprise Social at Microsoft.</em></p>
<p>At the SharePoint Conference in March, we announced our roadmap for a set of connected experiences that would enable your company to <a href="http://aka.ms/esspc">work like a network</a>. This month, we reached an important milestone with <a href="http://blogs.office.com/2014/09/08/milestone-office-delve/">Office Delve</a>. Continuing on this journey, today we are rolling out the first phase of Groups in Office 365.</p>
<p><a href="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/OWA_Group_Conversation_Feed.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-74261 size-large" style="margin: 20px;" src="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/OWA_Group_Conversation_Feed-1024x517.png" alt="OWA Groups conversation feed" width="640" height="323" /></a></p>
<p>Getting things done at work means sharing information and collaborating across ad hoc groups and project teams.  But, often times the tools we use to bring people together are different in each app—distribution groups in Outlook, buddy lists in Lync, groups in Yammer.  That’s why we’re introducing Groups in Office 365, so you can easily connect with the colleagues, information and applications you need to do more.</p>
<p>Take a look at this video to learn how Groups brings people together to enable better communication and collaboration across Office 365.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/t3OLvYXepvE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>To support a project, you can easily create a new Group and invite colleagues. You can also search for and join existing Groups, which are open by default, to see all discussions, milestones and files and get up to speed quickly.  Of course, you can create private Groups as well for sensitive projects and content.</p>
<p>We’re launching Groups in stages starting today.  In this initial phase, Groups will show up within the web experiences of Office 365 email and calendar and OneDrive for Business.  In upcoming phases, we will add Yammer and Lync to the Groups experience to help you do even more.</p>
<p>I’m excited for you to explore the possibilities with Groups to improve collaboration and begin working like a network!</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Jared Spataro</em></p>
<h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>
<p><strong>Q. When will Groups be rolled out to Office 365 customers?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Groups will roll out to Office 365 customers in phases, first to customers that have elected to receive significant Office 365 service updates at <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/office365-suite-help/office-365-release-programs-HA104204958.aspx">first release</a>, an opt-in program. Following that, Groups will roll out to all Office 365 customers over several months in standard release, the default option for Office 365 customers. We expect Groups to roll out to all eligible Office 365 customers by the end of this year.</p>
<p><strong>Q. Which Office 365 plans include Groups?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. </strong>Groups is a feature that is available in Outlook Web App email and calendar and OneDrive for Business, and will be rolled out to all customers that have an Exchange Online or Office 365 commercial subscription, both new and existing. Eligible Office 365 plans include the Office 365 Enterprise E1–E4 subscription plans (including the corresponding A2–A4 and G1–G4 plans for Academic and Government customers, respectively), Office 365 Business Essentials and Business Premium plans, Office 365 Small Business, Small Business Premium and Midsize Business plans and Office 365 Kiosk plan.</p>
<p><strong>Q. Where can I go to learn more information about Groups?</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em> Victor Boctor is a principal architect on the Exchange team.</em></p>
<p>Last month, we released the <a href="https://github.com/OfficeDev/ews-java-api">Exchange Web Services (EWS) Java API </a>as open source under the MIT license. Since then, we have received great feedback from the community, including many contributions via <a href="https://github.com/OfficeDev/ews-java-api/issues">bug reports </a>and <a href="https://github.com/OfficeDev/ews-java-api/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr">pull requests</a>. Today, we are building on this momentum by releasing the EWS Managed API, the .NET implementation of this API, as open source. Unlike the EWS Java API, this is the first time that the EWS Managed API has been made available as an open-source library. The open-source EWS Managed API provides the following advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can contribute bug fixes and enhancements to enable scenarios that you care about while making integrating with Exchange even more awesome than it is today.</li>
<li>You can use builds from dev or stable release branches to get fixes and enhancements that haven’t made their way into an official release.</li>
<li>You have access to the most comprehensive and up-to-date implementation of the API. You can also use it as a reference for the Java client library, or to create new libraries for even more platforms.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #404040;">The source code is now on GitHub via the </span><a href="https://github.com/officedev/ews-managed-api"><span style="color: #0044cc;">ews-managed-api project</span></a><span style="color: #404040;">, which is the primary development platform for the API. We welcome </span><a href="https://github.com/OfficeDev/ews-managed-api/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md"><span style="color: #0044cc;">contributions</span></a><span style="color: #404040;"> from the community via GitHub issues, pull requests, and more. To learn more about the EWS Managed API, see </span><a href="https://github.com/OfficeDev/ews-managed-api/blob/master/README.md"><span style="color: #0044cc;">Get started with EWS Managed API client applications</span></a><span style="color: #404040;"> and the </span><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj220535(v=exchg.80).aspx"><span style="color: #0044cc;">EWS Managed API reference</span></a><span style="color: #404040;"> content on MSDN. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #404040;">The Exchange team will continue to release new versions of the EWS Managed API. Our goal is to move from web downloads to an official package available via </span><a href="http://www.nuget.org/"><span style="color: #0044cc;">nuget.org</span></a><span style="color: #404040;">. Let’s see if someone beats us to adding nuget support. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #404040;">Thank you for your interest in Exchange. We welcome any feedback you have on our APIs and look forward to your using and improving them.</span>​</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the summer, a crew of interns joined the PowerPoint team and our goal for them was to experience the excitement of designing and implementing features for PowerPoint Online. We tasked our interns with delivering a feature that you, our customers, have been asking for—the ability to format slide backgrounds in PowerPoint Online, which is known as Format Background in PowerPoint desktop. The PowerPoint Online implementation of this feature was designed by a program manager intern, coded by a developer intern and has been thoroughly tested by our engineering team to ensure that it meets a high quality bar. Our interns have now returned to their respective universities, but their contributions are available to all our PowerPoint Online users around the world.</p>
<p>Much like in PowerPoint desktop, you can find the Format Background feature on the Design tab.</p>
<p><a href="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/PowerPoint-Online-Format-Backround.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-72602" src="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/PowerPoint-Online-Format-Backround-1024x391.png" alt="PowerPoint Online Format Backround" width="800" height="306" /></a></p>
<p>From there, you can then choose to change your slide background to a solid color or to a picture that is saved on your computer. After you format the background of your slide, you can use the <strong>Apply to All </strong>option to apply the background of the current slide to all the other slides in your presentation. For more information, check out the <a href="http://aka.ms/qhlj2d">help topic</a> that explains how to use the feature.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Travis Rhodes is senior security lead for Office 365</em>.</p>
<p>Today we’re announcing the participation of Office 365 in the new <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/bluehat/archive/2014/09/23/bug-bounty-evolution-online-services.aspx">Microsoft Online Services Bug Bounty Program</a>. Through this program, which launches today, we are able to reward and recognize security researchers by offering a bounty for qualifying security vulnerabilities they report to us. We are participating in this program for a number of reasons, chief among them are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>We take security vulnerabilities very seriously. </strong>We recognize that you, our customers, depend on us for tools to run your organizations, whether that is a Fortune 500 company, a small business, a non-profit, or an educational institution. We take it seriously that you trust us with your data, and this program is part of our investment in continually improving the security of our services. You can find more details about our broader investments in security, compliance and privacy on the <a href="http://trust.office365.com/">Office 365 Trust Center</a>.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>You asked us for it.</strong> Our customers are security conscious, and want the freedom to examine and understand the security profile of our offerings. With the <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/security/dn800983">program terms</a> announced today, there is now a framework for enabling targeted security vulnerability assessments of Office 365 services by anyone who wishes to participate.  With these rules, you can now validate the security of the service, and if you identify issues and meet the eligibility requirements, Microsoft will compensate you for that good work.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>This is the right thing to do for our customers and our services</strong>. In Office 365, we have security teams that use industry trends and emerging threats to drive internal and external penetration tests and conduct vulnerability scans and assessments throughout the lifecycle of development and operation of the service. Office 365 pursues and receives many rigorous <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/business/office-365-trust-center-top-10-trust-tenets-cloud-security-and-privacy-FX104029824.aspx#complianceStandards">third-party security and compliance accreditations</a> to provide customers with third-party audited proof of our implementation of best practices. We work hard to develop secure software and defend our services from breaches, but we recognize that security is a journey and not a destination, and we are always looking for ways to move faster.  This bounty program is one more way that we can enable and recognize that great community that helps us make Office 365 even safer.</li>
</ol>
<p>We encourage you to read the program terms and <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/dn425055">FAQs</a> before beginning your research or reporting a vulnerability. We would like to extend a big ‘Thank you’ to everyone in the community who has reported issues in Office 365 in the past, and we are looking forward to rewarding your efforts in the future.</p>
<p>—Travis Rhodes</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Today’s post on Finnair’s move to Office 365 is excerpted from the full <a href="https://customers.microsoft.com/Pages/CustomerStory.aspx?recid=6761">case study</a>.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/Finnair-logo.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-71751" src="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/Finnair-logo.png" alt="Finnair logo" width="300" height="33" /></a></p>
<p>The airline industry has seen its share of turbulence over the last decade, as mega-airlines merge and acquire smaller players, more regional airlines take to the air, and customers aggressively seek online bargains. Finnair, Finland’s largest airline and the fifth oldest airline in the world, has remained successful because it knows how to adapt and find smarter ways to operate.</p>
<p>In the face of many new low-cost air carriers springing up across Europe, Finnair still dominates both domestic and international air travel in Finland. “We have survived because we’ve been successful at keeping our costs under control, but we also understand that you can’t cut costs at the expense of customer satisfaction and employee effectiveness,” says Kari Hänninen, Architect in Corporate Information Management for Finnair. “We have to compete for the best people, who want a modern work environment where they are valued and listened to.”</p>
<h3>Gain rock-solid, spam-free email</h3>
<p><a href="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/Finnair.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-71831" src="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/Finnair-300x137.png" alt="Finnair" width="350" height="160" /></a>Finnair decided to unplug its expensive email and file-share servers and throw away its mix of document-sharing tools. In their place, it gave employees subscriptions to Microsoft Office 365.</p>
<p>“We ran a small pilot program of Google Docs, but Google doesn’t work well with Office, which all employees use, and its pricing model is not that great,” Hänninen says. “Microsoft had a far stronger federated enterprise solution, better support, a more convincing story around total cost and a more enterprise-ready, innovative solution.”</p>
<p>Finnair pilots, gate agents, mechanics and office staff now have anytime, any-device access to their email, which helps keep everyone on the same page. Office 365 filters all Finnair email for spam and malware to help keep communications more secure. “We switched from Postini to Exchange Online Protection (EOP), the Office 365 spam filtering technology, in just one day,” Hänninen says. “The EOP interface is familiar and easy to use and the filtering is excellent. We get rock-solid protection with financially backed service-level agreements. And because it’s part of Office 365, it’s more cost-effective to manage.” Finnair is able to easily create targeted email filtering rules for different roles.</p>
<h3>Help employees find their voice</h3>
<p>It’s easy for Finnair gate agents, cabin crew, and pilots to feel disconnected from decisions being made at headquarters. Employees use social networking capabilities built into Office 365 to participate in relevant conversations. “It’s very easy to get a snapshot of issues, to contribute, and to invite others to join a conversation,” Hänninen says. “If you have something to contribute that could help the business, now you can. It really helps people feel that they are heard and also helps them get the information they need to make better decisions.”</p>
<h3>Reduce costs by 15 percent</h3>
<p>Although the benefits of bringing its workforce closer together have been far-reaching, the reality is that there would have been no refresh unless it had involved saving money. “With Office 365, we have eliminated recurring software upgrade costs and the extra cost of Postini,” Hänninen says. “Over six years, Office 365 will be 15 percent less expensive than maintaining our own email servers. Plus, paying for software as a per-user fee makes it much easier to predict and budget.”</p>

<p>Since we announced that Outlook.com had introduced <a href="http://blogs.office.com/2014/05/13/outlook-com-introduces-the-most-sophisticated-rules-in-webmail/">the most sophisticated rules in webmail</a>, we’ve heard a great response from a lot of our customers who are using the feature to manage their inbox. Today, we want to provide you with a few examples of Advanced Rules, so you can try them out yourself—if you haven’t already.</p>
<p>The way we see it, each rule has its own personality—and it’s a personality that you can create. ‘The Auto-Archiver’ helps you get organized, ‘The Golden Child’ helps you remember things and ‘The Bouncer’ protects your inbox from mail you don’t want. When combined, Advanced Rules allow you to customize your inbox so that it can manage itself. To help you get started, here are these examples plus a few more to try for yourself.</p>
<p>(<strong>Hint:</strong> If you want to use any of these personalities, just click the corresponding image or title to be taken to the set up page for the rule. You may need to sign in first.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/Student-Advantage-Program.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-72751 size-full" src="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/Student-Advantage-Program.png" alt="Student Advantage Program" width="258" height="143" /></a>It was just about a year ago we announced <a href="http://blogs.office.com/2013/10/15/announcing-student-advantage/">Student Advantage</a>, a benefit that allows eligible students to get Office 365 from their school for free. One drawback to Student Advantage—the onus has been on the school to initiate the service, create an account and order the Office 365 license on behalf of the student.</p>
<p>Today we’re making it easier on the school IT department with a new self-serve model for students that lets them sign up for the free service on their own.</p>
<p>If you’re a student 13 years-old of age or older, here’s what you can do the check your eligibility and get Office for free:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="http://www.office.com/getoffice365">Office 365 for Students</a>.</li>
<li>Enter a valid school-provided email address.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s what qualified students will receive:</p>
<ul>
<li>The latest versions of Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, Access and Publisher</li>
<li>Installation on up to five PCs or Macs, and Office apps on other mobile devices including Windows tablets and iPad</li>
<li>1 Terabyte of OneDrive cloud storage</li>
<li>Office Online</li>
</ul>
<p>Sign-up for students is available in the U.S. today, and will expand worldwide later this year.</p>
<p>In order to be eligible for this benefit, the student must attend a school that has purchased Office organization-wide for all faculty/staff via the Microsoft Volume Licensing program.</p>
<p>You can see the new sign-up process on the Garage Series with host Jeremy Chapman as well as other really cool features of Office Mix, Power Map and OneNote.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/QE9ksm7ZONM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>These changes not only make it easier for students to get Office, but it makes managing the services easier on school IT. In the past, organizations were required to initiate the service, create accounts and order the free licenses on behalf of their students. All this needed to be done prior to students being able to access Office and OneDrive. The new self-service model removes all of that unnecessary friction and delay by simply allowing eligible students to sign up for the service themselves, while maintaining the same level of control, flexibility and security institutions have come to expect from Office 365.</p>
<h3>Office 365 ProPlus benefit available for faculty and staff  starting December 1, 2014</h3>
<p>We have even more great news to share—we’re also announcing that faculty and staff will soon be able to access the same Office 365 ProPlus benefit as their students. This means that any organization purchasing Office for all of their faculty and staff can now include an Office 365 ProPlus subscription at no extra cost for all students, faculty and staff.</p>
<p>Extending the <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/business/office-365-proplus-business-software-FX103213513.aspx">Office 365 ProPlus</a> benefit to faculty and staff ensures that teachers are using the latest versions of Office and the same feature set as their students. It will allow teachers to install full Office on up to five PCs or Macs and unlock the editing capabilities of the Office apps for iPad. It also gives them access to all their Office documents both at school and at home. With Office 365 ProPlus teachers can take advantage of great Office apps and add-ins like <a href="https://mix.office.com/Gallery">Office Mix</a> to record and publish class lectures.</p>
<p>Teachers in the U.S. can sign up for Office 365 ProPlus in October and expand to worldwide teachers later this year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Starting something new. We&#8217;ve all been there. The first day of school, starting a new job, or even moving to a new town. As we become familiar with the new surroundings, buildings, new faces and personalities, schedules, and rhythms we start with a home base from which to explore.</p>
<p>Using technology is no different. It’s important to have a home base where you can start, a place where you can access all of your services, downloads and settings and launch into new experiences, applications and adventures to expand your possibilities.</p>
<p>Today we’re announcing a new home page experience in Office 365. We’re rolling out the new home page to current Exchange or SharePoint customers now. Customers can access the home page from the web experience of Office 365, which you get to by signing in to the <a href="http://portal.office.com/">Office 365 portal</a>.</p>
<p>Once there, you just click the Office 365 logo in the top left-hand web navigation to go to the home page. New customers will automatically land on this home page when they first sign into Office 365.</p>
<p>The new home page is not just a place where you can easily access all the services available to you. Customers who are licensed for Office 365 ProPlus can also access the downloads to install the Office applications from this page. The home page automatically detects the device you’re using, and displays the appropriate install prompt. For example, if you’re using a PC, it prompts you to install the applications on your PC, as the image below shows. If you’re using a Mac, it prompts you to install Office for Mac.</p>
<p><a href="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/The-New-Office-Homepage.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-72341" src="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/The-New-Office-Homepage.png" alt="The New Office Homepage" width="800" height="354" /></a></p>
<p>Once you have installed the Office applications, the home page displays all your Office 365 online services, providing you with quick access to launch documents and start creating right away.</p>
<p><a href="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/Homepage-apps-and-services.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-72331" src="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/Homepage-apps-and-services.png" alt="Homepage apps and services" width="800" height="384" /></a></p>
<p>You may want to use this new home page as your start page—for consistent and comprehensive access to your services. Going forward, we will introduce new Office 365 services via the home page, so you’ll always be aware of and have immediate access to the latest services available to you—like Yammer and Delve. In this way, the home page gives you a convenient map of all your services and provides easy navigation and quick access to the tools you rely on to get your work done, plus a way to explore new tools and services.</p>
<p>You may prefer to use a different start page. Instead of landing on the new home page, you might want to start in Outlook, OneDrive, SharePoint or Yammer. In order to accommodate a variety of start preferences, we’re also providing the ability for you to determine your own default landing page when you sign in to Office 365 via portal.office.com. You can set your start page preference with a few clicks. Click the <strong>gear</strong> icon in the top right of the navigation bar, and then click <strong>Office 365 settings</strong>. On the settings page, click <strong>Start page</strong> on the left hand side, select the page you want from the drop-down list, and then click<strong> Save</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/Office-365-settings-v2.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-72811" src="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/Office-365-settings-v2.png" alt="Office 365 settings v2" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we continue to innovate and add new exciting services like Delve and Yammer to Office 365, your home page provides an important foundation for exploring and navigating within the array of services you use every day.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Today’s post about Office 365 was written by Anders Munck, enterprise architect with the Carlsberg Group.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/Carlsberg-logo.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-71391" src="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/Carlsberg-logo-300x125.png" alt="Carlsberg logo" width="300" height="125" /></a>The past 14 years have been some of the most tumultuous in Carlsberg’s 167-year history of manufacturing beer. We used to license our beer to other breweries, but when our competitors started buying them up, we had to change our business model. So we began acquiring our own breweries. We’ve grown from serving four small markets in 2000 to successfully reinventing ourselves as a global beer brand. Becoming the fourth-largest brewer in the world brought with it a huge challenge: how do we incorporate many globally dispersed businesses into one company? And how do we ensure that our 500 different brands all live up to Carlsberg’s high standard of excellence?</p>
<p>To address these questions, Carlsberg introduced a vision for the business that we call “GloCal,” which talks about building one common culture, while staying true to our local roots. We can aim for global efficiencies, but we can never lose sight of the fact that people are very attached to their local brew. So, as the company took steps to enable the GloCal vision—for example, launching the Carlsberg Supply Chain (CSC) company to streamline our global supply chain—in IT we began thinking about how we could use technology to play a role in enabling that vision. We began looking for a single communication and collaboration solution that employees could use to connect with one another around the world. We chose Microsoft Office 365 as a key solution to help push the company toward realizing its GloCal objectives.</p>
<p>As the first global IT service we’ve introduced in Carlsberg, Office 365 is a game changing experience. As we deploy our new global collaboration services to support the procurement, production, logistics, and planning functions that used to occur in isolation all over the world, we’ll begin to enjoy the benefits that come with centralized planning and economies of scale. When everyone works together, it’s easier for Carlsberg to deliver the right product at the right time, to the right location, at the right quantity and price so that the millions of retail outlets, restaurants, and bars that sell Carlsberg beer will be even happier to work with us.</p>
<p><a href="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/Carlsberg-CEO.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-71401 size-medium" src="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/Carlsberg-CEO-300x222.png" alt="Anders Munck enterprise architect with the Carlsberg Group" width="300" height="222" /></a>We need to ensure that our consumers continue to love Carlsberg beer by guaranteeing that breweries all over the world operate at the same high standards. This can be a challenge because a beer brewed in a small brewery in Western China is not going to be the same as a beer brewed in one of our gigantic Russian operations. But through Office 365, we support our breweries all over the world in staying true to local market preferences, yet ensuring that all our beers have that special Carlsberg quality.</p>
<p>We’re also seeing improved innovation at Carlsberg, thanks to the social media that people are using to drive creativity through spontaneous conversations—from the latest technologies for aluminum beer cans to how to create really eye-catching packaging.</p>
<p>When we finish deployment, approximately 20,000 employees will be using some, or all, of the Office 365 online tool set to create vital connections that build the corporate culture we need to compete globally. I see it already in the dynamic interplay of our web conferences. Yes, we save money by not flying hundreds of people around the world, but the real benefit is the relationship building and lively discussions that generate fruitful ideas and build camaraderie. Instead of watching a distant manager’s PowerPoint presentation alone in your office, we’re having face-to-face conversations that help to build a sense of belonging in our widespread organization. At the end of the day, beer is about congenial experiences; Office 365 extends that notion to the workplace. We are using it to engender a sense of pride in our company that generates the productivity and drive we need for Carlsberg to win on a global scale.</p>
<p>—Anders Munck</p>
<p>Read <a href="https://customers.microsoft.com/Pages/CustomerStory.aspx?recid=7900">Carlsberg Group case study</a> to learn how the Carlsberg Group is using Office 365 to become GloCal.</p>
<h3><strong>The technologies involved</strong></h3>
<p>Most of the 40,000 employees at the Carlsberg Group use the Microsoft Office 365 Enterprise E3 plan. This plan includes Office 365 ProPlus, the familiar Office desktop suite, which employees can download on more than five devices and work productively with synced files on all of them. Employees use Microsoft Exchange Online for email and calendaring and Microsoft Lync Online to connect via web conferencing and instant messaging. Virtual teams are beginning to adopt Microsoft SharePoint Online to collaborate on projects, and employees are adopting the Yammer enterprise social networking platform for messaging and collaboration on product innovation. And when the company deploys OneDrive for Business for online document storage, employees will be able to access the latest version of their files on any device anywhere.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Today’s post on OneNote was written by Avneesh Kohli, program manager on the OneNote team. </em></p>
<p>Today, we&#8217;re announcing the OneNote Share extension update for your iPad and iPhone, making it easier than ever to send content from your favorite apps to OneNote. All you need is an iPhone or iPad running iOS 8, the new operating system.</p>
<p>Get started by downloading <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-onenote-for-ipad/id478105721?mt=8">OneNote for iPad</a> or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-onenote/id410395246?mt=8">OneNote for iPhone</a> for free from the App Store. If you already have OneNote installed, simply open the App Store and get the latest version from the Updates tab available. As soon as your phone updates to iOS 8,  you&#8217;ll be ready to use the Share Extension<strong>. </strong>Lastly, make sure are signed into OneNote with your Microsoft account on your iOS device, so you can enable the Share extension functionality.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/aiJyST4hO5g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>You can enable the OneNote Share extension with just a few taps and you only need to do this once. To get started, display any Share menu. Here’s where you can find it in Safari:</p>
<p><a href="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/OneNote-Share-extension-step-1.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-71061" src="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/OneNote-Share-extension-step-1-1024x890.png" alt="OneNote Share extension step 1" width="500" height="435" /></a></p>
<p>Next tap <strong>More</strong> to display the list of all the extensions you have installed on your iOS device. OneNote will appear in this list. Toggle the switch to add OneNote to the Share menu.</p>
<p><a href="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/OneNote-Share-extension-step-2.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-71052" src="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/OneNote-Share-extension-step-2-1024x762.png" alt="OneNote Share extension step 2" width="500" height="372" /></a></p>
<p>Once it&#8217;s enabled, tap <strong>Done</strong>. You are returned to the main Share menu and the OneNote Share extension is now visible.</p>
<p><a href="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/OneNote-Share-extension-step-3.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-71051" src="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/OneNote-Share-extension-step-3-1024x894.png" alt="OneNote Share extension step 3" width="500" height="437" /></a></p>
<h3>Start sharing content from any app</h3>
<p>Once enabled, the OneNote Share extension makes it easy to clip websites, export file attachments, save photos and more. Simply look for the <strong>Share</strong> button in any app and tap <strong>OneNote</strong> to start sharing content. For example, to save a webpage in Safari to OneNote, tap the <strong>Share</strong> icon in the top right and select <strong>OneNote</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/OneNote-Share-extension-step-4.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-71041" src="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/OneNote-Share-extension-step-4-1024x894.png" alt="OneNote Share extension step 4" width="500" height="437" /></a><br />
The OneNote Share extension will appear right in Safari.</p>
<p><a href="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/OneNote-Share-extension-step-5.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-71031" src="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/OneNote-Share-extension-step-5.png" alt="OneNote Share extension step 5" width="640" height="463" /></a></p>
<p>A couple of features to point out here:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can select exactly where you&#8217;d like to store your content—just tap <strong>Location</strong> and select your preferred notebook and section. The OneNote Share extension supports sending content to both OneDrive and OneDrive for Business notebooks.</li>
<li>OneNote automatically populates the title field with the name of the webpage. Want to change it? No problem, just tap and edit.</li>
<li>If you want to add some additional notes to your clipping, whether it be some extra context or just something you want to make sure you don&#8217;t forget, just add it to the <strong>Note</strong> field.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;ve got an internet connection, OneNote will show you a preview of the webpage and will include the entire webpage when it’s saved it to your notes.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t worry, the URL is saved for you as well, in case you&#8217;d like to return to the page later or on another device.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, tap <strong>Send</strong>.</p>
<p>The next time you open OneNote, your notes are imported and available on all your devices. We’ve also designed the Share extension to work even if you’re offline, so if you’re on the go with your iPad or want to limit your cellular data usage, we’ve got you covered.</p>
<p>Here’s just a sampling of the types of content you can send to OneNote using the new Share extension.</p>
<p><a href="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/OneNote-Share-extension-step-6.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-71012 size-large" src="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/OneNote-Share-extension-step-6-1024x741.png" alt="OneNote Share extension step 6" width="640" height="463" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/OneNote-Share-extension-Device-example.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-71011" src="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/OneNote-Share-extension-Device-example.png" alt="OneNote Share extension Device example" width="614" height="624" /></a></p>
<p>Whether it’s class notes, recipes or travel plans—the more content you put into OneNote, the more you get out of OneNote. Countless people have expressed this to us, and as a result we&#8217;ve been laser-focused on making it easy to get everything you need to remember into OneNote. We hope you’ll love OneNote Share extension as much as we do.</p>
<p>As always, we want to <a href="https://onenote.uservoice.com/">hear your feedback</a> so that we can continue to improve your OneNote experience—making it the best place to store your notes and memories. We read through every piece of feedback we receive!<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re building a set of starter projects that are intended to help you become familiar with the different Office 365 client libraries on the platforms you care about. In each project, we’ll show you how to use the client libraries to integrate your users’ Office 365 data into your app.</p>
<p>Using the Office 365 client libraries can simplify your life greatly as you code against the Office 365 APIs from your app. Here are just a few  examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the client libraries’ authentication business logic for getting the client access token. This means you don’t have to implement the authentication, authorization, and consent workflow that’s required for OAuth.</li>
<li>The client libraries remove the requirement to implement JSON serialization/deserialization in to/from objects; they have parity with the service metadata description; they manage the client access token; and they can make the object model easier to use.</li>
<li>Using the client libraries, you can leverage the Office 365 services to access your users’ calendar, mail, contacts, files, and sites.</li>
<li>Use the client libraries’ segmentation of feature access and user permissions. This means you can limit the access to specific features (for example, give access to contacts, but not email), as well as limit particular actions (for example, give read-only access).</li>
</ul>
<p>We just shipped our first starter project to GitHub, <a href="http://aka.ms/o365-apis-start-windows-b">Office 365 APIs Starter Project for Windows</a>, and we can’t wait to hear what you think. The sample demonstrates how you can use the Office 365 API client libraries to integrate your users&#8217; Office 365 data into your Windows Store app. <a href="http://aka.ms/o365-apis-start-windows-b-master">Download it today!</a></p>
<p>Over the coming months we hope to also deliver starter projects for ASP.NET MVC, Android using Eclipse, Android using Xamarin, Cordova and many more. Check back here for updates to this project and announcements of new starter projects.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://aka.ms/o365-apis-start-windows-b">Office 365 APIs Starter Project for Windows</a> can help you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn how the client libraries provided by <a href="http://blogs.office.com/2014/08/05/office-365-api-tool-visual-studio-2013-summer-update/">Office 365 API Tools</a> are used to make calls that target data stored in Office 365.</li>
<li>Build a Windows Store app that integrates your user’s Office 365 data.</li>
<li>Learn how to access calendar, files, folders and user information from Office 365.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s take a look at the code in the Office 365 APIs Starter Project for Windows sample. If you haven’t already, we suggest that you <a href="http://aka.ms/o365-apis-start-windows-b-master">download or clone</a> this sample to your desktop and install it. The <a href="http://aka.ms/o365-apis-start-windows-b-readme">readme</a> file contains the instructions for setting up the sample so that you can run it against a demo tenant.</p>
<h3>Authenticate and get user information</h3>
<p>When the sample is launched, you’ll see the screen shown below. Among other things, this page lists the Office 365 services with which you can interact.</p>
<p><a href="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/MainPage.xaml-is-where-you-connect-to-Office-365.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-72261 size-full" src="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/MainPage.xaml-is-where-you-connect-to-Office-365.png" alt="MainPage.xaml is where you connect to Office 365" width="750" height="468" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="http://aka.ms/o365-apis-start-windows-b-mainpagexaml">MainPage.xaml</a></em><em> is where you connect to Office 365. </em></p>
<p>From here, you can connect to your Office 365 tenant. The <strong>Sign In</strong> button triggers a webpage that asks for your consent to allow this application to connect to the services requested by this application. This will get the access token that your application will use to connect to the service. The code we use to connect to the Office 365 services is found in the <a href="http://aka.ms/o365-apis-start-windows-b-authhelp">AuthenticationHelper.cs</a> file. After the user has consented to let the application connect to the Office 365 services, we get the signed-in user’s information from Azure Active Directory (note that the Thumbnail feature is not available in this release). This work is carried out in the <a href="http://aka.ms/o365-apis-start-windows-b-userop">UserOperations.cs</a> file.</p>
<h3>Calendar API: Create, read, update and delete calendar events from your Office 365 calendar</h3>
<p>Select the <strong>Calendar</strong> button on the start page to launch the Office 365 Calendar API example page, to work with your calendar events stored in Office 365. This is shown in the image below.</p>
<p><a href="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/Calendar.xaml-is-where-you-access-Office-365-events.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72241" src="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/Calendar.xaml-is-where-you-access-Office-365-events.png" alt="Calendar.xaml is where you access Office 365 events" width="938" height="601" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="http://aka.ms/o365-apis-start-windows-b-calendarxaml">Calendar.xaml</a></em><em> is where you access Office 365 events. </em></p>
<p>This page uses the <a href="http://aka.ms/o365-apis-start-windows-b-calendarviewmodel">CalendarViewModel.cs</a> and <a href="http://aka.ms/o365-apis-start-windows-b-eventviewmodel">EventViewModel.cs</a> files to access calendar information stored in your calendar. Look at <a href="http://aka.ms/o365-apis-start-windows-b-calendarops">CalendarOperations.cs</a> to learn how you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the list of calendar events</li>
<li>Create a new event</li>
<li>Update an existing event</li>
<li>Remove an event from your calendar.</li>
</ul>
<h3>My Files API: Create, read, update and delete your files stored in SharePoint</h3>
<p>Select the <strong>Files</strong> button from the start page to launch the Office 365 Files API example page, to access your files and folders in Office 365. You can see this in the image below.</p>
<p><a href="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/MyFiles.xaml-is-where-you-access-Office-365-files-and-folders.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72251" src="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/MyFiles.xaml-is-where-you-access-Office-365-files-and-folders.png" alt="MyFiles.xaml is where you access Office 365 files and folders" width="937" height="601" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="http://aka.ms/o365-apis-start-windows-b-myfilesxaml">MyFiles.xaml</a></em><em> is where you access Office 365 files and folders</em>.</p>
<p>This page uses the <a href="http://aka.ms/o365-apis-start-windows-b-filesviewmodel">FilesViewModel.cs</a> and <a href="http://aka.ms/o365-apis-start-windows-b-filesystemitem">FileSystemItemViewModel.cs</a> to access files and folder information stored in SharePoint. Look at <a href="http://aka.ms/o365-apis-start-windows-b-fileop">FileOperations.cs</a> to learn how to make calls to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get a list of all the files and folders in your default documents directory and sub-directory.</li>
<li>Create a simple text file.</li>
<li>Upload a file to SharePoint.</li>
<li>Delete a file or folder.</li>
<li>Read the contents of text file.</li>
<li>Update the contents of a text file.</li>
<li>Download a file. The code to then open the file is located in <a href="http://aka.ms/o365-apis-start-windows-b-filesviewmodel">FilesViewModel.cs</a>.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Today’s post about Office 365 was written by Cindy Lyman, chief financial officer at Associated Industries of Massachusetts. </em></p>
<p><a href="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/AIM-logo.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-71481" src="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/AIM-logo-300x206.png" alt="AIM logo" width="300" height="206" /></a></p>
<p>It’s not always easy to age gracefully. As an association that’s nearly 100 years old, Associated Industries of Massachusetts (AIM) has always adapted to changing member needs, governmental structures and—now more than ever—technological expectations.</p>
<p>AIM is the largest statewide association of Massachusetts employers, with a mission to improve the financial performance of member employers through a unique combination of lobbying, management and human-resource services. The 4,500 members and 49 employees of AIM work together to create economic opportunity by reducing business costs, shaping state and federal regulation, and ensuring an educated work force.</p>
<p><a href="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/Cindy-Lyman-chief-financial-officer-at-Associated-Industries-of-Massachusetts.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-71471" src="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/Cindy-Lyman-chief-financial-officer-at-Associated-Industries-of-Massachusetts-300x279.png" alt="Cindy Lyman chief financial officer at Associated Industries of Massachusetts" width="300" height="279" /></a>One of our primary challenges at AIM is to respond quickly to member needs and changing conditions. We have a mobile staff located throughout Massachusetts so that we can respond from anywhere—from Beacon Hill in Boston, a member’s facility in Springfield, an AIM training event, or even at home.</p>
<p>Our technology systems in the past presented accessibility barriers that were tough to overcome, making it difficult for us to be responsive. We had older servers and disparate systems that didn’t always play nicely together. We had to jump through multiple hoops just to remain effective. I recall having to email documents to myself so that I could work on them at home because I wasn’t confident I’d be able to get consistent access to our shared files.</p>
<p>Staff members would log on remotely only to be disconnected from our network for no apparent reason. Allowing the right people to access the right information at the right time wasn’t something we could always achieve. We were frustrated that many of our members were moving ahead with advanced communications capabilities—instant messaging, web services and e-commerce—and we just weren’t there yet.</p>
<p>That’s why we began to explore what it would mean to upgrade our IT environment so that we could better serve our members. We made the decision to look beyond merely upgrading email or an isolated system here and there and chose instead to identify productivity software and database systems (for example, an association management system) that could give employees and members a more cohesive experience. It was pretty easy to see that moving to the cloud was the way to go, both from user and management standpoints, giving employees the “anywhere” access they needed. And we knew that a cloud-based solution for an organization of our size would be cost-effective both today and in the future.</p>
<p>We evaluated a range of options and concluded that we could provide our employees a better experience and a tighter level of security by adopting Microsoft Office 365. Our employees were already accustomed to using Microsoft products, so we knew that adopting the more robust set of tools in Office 365 would be easy. We also knew that Office 365 was the right choice because it could interoperate with the Microsoft Dynamics CRM platform (our choice for an association management system), and it would work seamlessly with our existing financial system, Microsoft Dynamics GP. We believed that Office 365 would support a better member experience, too.</p>
<p>With the decision made to move forward with Office 365, we engaged a local Microsoft Managed Services Provider, iCorps Technologies, to help us make the leap into the cloud. We were understandably nervous—it was a very different way for us to think about communication and data—so it was helpful to have consultants with expertise there to ease the transition.<strong> </strong> iCorps was great to work with, they created a customized O365 demo experience for AIM, developed the O365 technical vision, led the migration, trained our end users and partnered with us through the journey  to ensure success.</p>
<p>Although still in the early stages of our Office 365 deployment, we’re already seeing the benefits. I no longer email documents to myself. I store them in the cloud using Microsoft OneDrive for Business and access them instantly from anywhere. Our employees have taken to OneDrive for Business, Microsoft Lync Online and Exchange Online. They are confident with its accessibility and use new features every day.</p>
<p>We are setting up Microsoft SharePoint Online team sites for members to access relevant documents and information without waiting for staff to email them, and we are establishing policies for how to use Lync Online and Exchange Online to share availability so that we can work better as a team. The future is now, and we see exciting opportunities. Perhaps we will soon convert our in-person member committee meetings to videoconferences using Lync Online, saving travel time and cost and encouraging collaboration while improving productivity.</p>
<p>As we approach our centennial, we have confidence that we’ve taken a major step toward moving at the pace of today’s business by adopting Office 365. Embracing technological innovation will help us continue to look out for our members’ interests while giving our staff the tools that we need to make the most of our time and resources.</p>
<p>—Cindy Lyman</p>
<h3><strong>Technical summary</strong></h3>
<p>Associated Industries of Massachusetts (AIM) is using a range of Microsoft Office 365 tools to increase productivity, especially among mobile workers. Employees now have Microsoft Exchange Online for reliable, accessible email and calendaring, and they use Microsoft Lync Online for both scheduled and spontaneous meetings, instant messaging, presence, and videoconferencing. AIM provides employees with access to up-to-date Microsoft Office programs through Office 365 ProPlus, and the organization relies on Microsoft OneDrive for Business for centralized document storage to make it easy to access documents from member locations and from home. AIM will share real-time updates on member issues and support member self-service through Microsoft SharePoint Online team sites. The organization supports the use of Windows Phones and Microsoft Surface tablets for its mobile workforce.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Kamal Janardhan is the principal program manager in the Office 365 Information Protection team.</em></p>
<p>In our last few From Inside the Cloud posts, we offered an insider’s perspective from lead engineers Perry Clarke, Vivek Sharma and Shawn Veney on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4QqQG8tTSg">how we protect your data at rest</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgmF_JOzb_k">who has access to your data within Office 365, </a>and how Office 365 does continuous compliance. They explained the various mitigations that we have in place for data security, access control, and ensuring that customers have the ability to comply with regulations or their own organizational policies.</p>
<p>These posts followed an overview on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAaO_maYowY">why trust Office 365</a> with Rajesh Jha, the head of Office 365 engineering, who emphasized how we ensure that you retain full ownership of your data in the Office 365 service. Today I want to take that aspect of the discussion a step or two further by exploring how this translates to the value that we are engineering into Office 365.</p>
<h3>How we aim to raise the bar on visibility and control of your organization’s data with the Office 365 service</h3>
<p>When you move to the cloud, a key tenet of ownership is the level of visibility and control you have over your data. In today&#8217;s From Inside the Cloud three-minute overview, I focus on how we want to raise the bar on that visibility and control, much beyond what you can do in your own on-premises environments today.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/lHnxXh8pl6Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span></p>
<p><a href="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/Kamal-Janardhan.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-71632" src="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/Kamal-Janardhan-300x167.png" alt="Kamal Janardhan" width="350" height="195" /></a>How do we hope to deliver on this vision of ownership? We believe that visibility and control means three things (1) being able to view the data (2) being able to take actions on it and (3) being aware of what actions were taken at any time.</p>
<p>In many on-premises environments today, achieving this level of visibility and control is more complex than it is in the cloud. The burden is on you to define and implement consistent configuration with appropriate data access and distribution policies across all your workloads. This can be a costly process and usually requires specialist staff for compliance and IT administration. In Office 365, that visibility into your organization&#8217;s workloads is integrated directly into the service.</p>
<p>Archiving and eDiscovery are built directly into Office 365 on the workload’s data store, so you can take actions like preservation, deletion, auditing, and data loss prevention, as well as do an organizational search using our eDiscovery tools, based on person, date range, keyword and other rich criteria. Because you are acting on the most recent version of the data in the workload, you can search within a user&#8217;s IM conversations, mailbox, or site libraries and preserve or delete as needed.</p>
<p>Viewing and acting on the data are privileged operations and within Office 365 we define roles that have these abilities for a given set of users. The scope and reach of these roles is defined by you, the customer, and our goal is to enable you to track all changes to these privileged roles. We also want to enable the compliance officer to keep the organization safe without disrupting the productivity of the user. With this in mind, when you perform an eDiscovery query, you can preserve, export, preview and copy the data without impact to the information worker. Our hope for the long term is to give you an organizational view that enables you to easily see the history of any action taken on your data by individuals in your organization. This history can drive your decisions to put proactive compliance controls in place or take reactive action to reduce risk.</p>
<p>Please share any and all feedback about what you see in Office 365. We’ve come a long way but still have farther to travel to fulfill the promise of our vision. We hope you’ll be willing to take that journey with us.</p>

<p>I’ve often heard that “a picture is worth a thousand words,” and with today’s update to the <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/office-lens/5681f21c-f257-4d62-83f5-5341788a5077">Office Lens</a> app on Windows Phone, such a translation is actually possible!</p>
<p>Office Lens is a great app for capturing whiteboard notes and paper documents and saving them in OneNote. Today it got even better with the ability to convert pictures of whiteboard notes and paper documents directly into Word documents and PowerPoint presentations—that you can edit, author and edit again.</p>
<h3>Converting hardcopy documents into Word files</h3>
<p>Take a picture of your hardcopy document using your phone and tap <strong>Save.</strong> A new Word document is automatically saved to your <a href="http://www.onedrive.com/">OneDrive</a>, so you can access it on any device.</p>
<p><a href="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/Office-Lens-word.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-71241" src="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/Office-Lens-word-1024x378.png" alt="Office Lens word" width="640" height="236" /></a></p>
<p>Don’t have the original document? Need a way to copy and paste from a handout, textbook or poster? Office Lens can do that for you.</p>
<p>For students, if you’re on your way to class and you notice a typo in a printed paper you&#8217;re about to hand in, just take a picture of it using Office Lens and convert it into a new Word file. You can then make the changes on your device and print it again when you get to campus.</p>
<h3>Converting pictures from whiteboards into PowerPoint files</h3>
<p>If you’re in a meeting and your marketing manager jots down a great storyboard idea for the big client you’re going to see next week, take a picture of the whiteboard using Office Lens and convert it directly into PowerPoint. Present the PowerPoint as is or edit the slide and embellish it with a few more great ideas.</p>
<p><a href="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/Office-Lens-whiteboard.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-71232" src="http://officeblogswest.blob.core.windows.net/wp-content/2014/09/Office-Lens-whiteboard-1024x401.png" alt="Office Lens whiteboard" width="640" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>Office Lens doesn’t just take a picture and import an image into a Word or PowerPoint file. The final Word and PowerPoint documents are real Office documents.</p>
<p>For Word, Office Lens recognizes the text and the document layout. All the text, formatting and layout in the Word document is preserved. Images of typed text become fully editable—just like you authored it at your desk.</p>
<p>For PowerPoint, all the handwritten lines and strokes are transformed into PowerPoint drawing objects that can be recolored, resized, repositioned and edited. That great infographic or sketch from one presentation can now be reused in other presentations.</p>
<p>And all Word and PowerPoint files are automatically saved to OneDrive, where they can be opened and edited from any device or even in your browser.  That document scanned in class or a meeting can then be edited by classmates or colleagues when you share with them via OneDrive.</p>
<p>You can see how all these new features in Office Lens work in the following video:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/UvvPxwyu3tE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t installed Office Lens on your Windows Phone, you can <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=5681f21c-f257-4d62-83f5-5341788a5077">download it for free</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have installed Office Lens, try printing and using Office Lens with the example Word and PowerPoint documents attached below to get an understanding of how it works.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“<a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/o/oscardelah498879.html">There is always space for improvement, no matter how long you&#8217;ve been in the business</a>,” according to boxing champion Oscar De La Hoya, who won 10 world titles in six different weight divisions before retiring from the sport in 2009. Microsoft Office has been helping people get things done in their personal and professional lives for the <a href="http://blogs.office.com/2014/08/01/tribute-25-years-office-users/">25 years</a>—yet we keep finding ways to improve the product and make it even better for our customers.</p>
<p>One of our most recent improvements to Office 365 is <a href="http://blogs.office.com/2014/09/08/milestone-office-delve/">Office Delve</a>, a new way for you to discover relevant information and connections from across your work life. Delve displays the information that is most relevant for each person in your network, based on the work they are doing and the people with whom they are engaging. We like to say that with Delve you no longer have to find information, the information finds you.</p>
<p>We’ve made several other recent improvements to Office 365 and related products. We recently <a href="http://blogs.microsoft.com/firehose/2014/09/10/got-a-big-file-to-share-you-can-now-upload-files-of-up-to-10-gb-on-onedrive/">increased the file-size limit on OneDrive</a> from 2GB to 10GB, so you can now store and share very large files with ease. We also tripled the syncing speed on OneDrive and made other improvements that make it easier to use. In addition, we introduced two valuable new features to Outlook Web App for Office 365. The first lets you <a href="http://blogs.office.com/2014/09/03/propose-new-time-new-feature-outlook-web-app-office-365/">propose a new time</a> if someone invites you to a meeting that creates a schedule conflict. The second is the new <a href="http://windowsitpro.com/office-365/new-people-view-feature-outlook-web-app-office-365">People View</a> feature that can help you manage your email more efficiently. We also <a href="http://blogs.office.com/2014/09/02/personalize-office-365-experience-selecting-themes/">introduced themes</a> to let you customize and personalize your Office 365 experience—and strengthen your brand. And we provided added flexibility for customers by introducing <a href="http://blogs.office.com/2014/09/02/post-title-office-ipad-now-supports-monthly-subscriptions/">monthly subscriptions</a> to Office 365 Personal and Office 365 Home for iPad users.</p>
<p>Oscar De La Hoya was a champion because he always kept improving and moving forward. The same is true for Office 365. When it comes to productivity, Office 365 is hard to beat.</p>
<p>Below is a round-up of some key news items from the last couple of weeks. Enjoy!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2605912/onedrive-now-allows-files-of-up-to-10gb.html">OneDrive&#8217;s file size limit upped to 10GB, syncing speeds tripled</a><em> – </em>Learn how Microsoft increased maximum file size on OneDrive from 2GB to 10GB, tripled the syncing speed, and made other cloud-storage improvements.</p>
