<p>The world&#8217;s biggest chip maker said it would take a 20 percent stake of Tsinghua Unigroup, the owner of <a href="http://www.spreadtrum.com" target="_blank">Spreadtrum Communications</a> and <a href="http://www.rdamicro.com/" target="_blank">RDA Microelectronics</a>. The deal is subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.</p>
<div id="attachment_1562100"  class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:400px;"><a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/09/25/intel-invests-1-5b-in-chinese-chip-makers/spreadtrum/" rel="attachment wp-att-1562100"><img src="http://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/spreadtrum.jpg?w=400&#038;h=298" alt="Spreadtrum Communications" width="400" height="298" class="size-full wp-image-1562100" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Above: Spreadtrum Communications</p><div class="vb_image_source"><em>Image Credit: Spreadtrum</em></div></div>
<p>Intel said the goal of the agreements is to expand the adoption of Intel-based mobile devices in China. The Chinese companies will jointly develop mobile phone technologies based on Intel architecture. Intel has set a goal of selling 40 million Intel-based tablet and smartphone chips in 2014, and it no doubt plans to increase that in 2015. This deal is one way that the company is going to accomplish that. In other words, it is buying market share.</p>
<p>An Intel spokesman put it more diplomatically. He said, &#8220;This collaboration and investment will also enhance our ability to support a wider range of mobile customers in China and the rest of the world by more quickly. We will be able to deliver a broader portfolio of Intel architecture and communications technology solutions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spreadtrum and RDA are &#8220;fabless&#8221; chip design firms, which means they design chips that are manufactured by others. They create chips for smartphones, feature phones, and other consumer electronics devices.</p>
<p>“China is now the largest consumption market for smartphones and has the largest number of Internet users in the world,” said Brian Krzanich, Intel CEO, in a statement. “These agreements with Tsinghua Unigroup underscore Intel’s 29-year-long history of investing in and working in China. This partnership will also enhance our ability to support a wider range of mobile customers in China and the rest of the world by more quickly delivering a broader portfolio of Intel architecture and communications technology solutions.”</p>
<p>Zhao Weiguo, chairman and president of Tsinghua Unigroup, added in a statement, “It has become a national priority of China to grow its semiconductor industry. The strategic collaboration between Tsinghua Unigroup and Intel ranges from design and development to marketing and equity investments, which demonstrate Intel’s confidence in the Chinese market and strong commitment to Chinese semiconductor industry, which will accelerate the technology development and further strengthen the competitiveness and market position of Chinese semiconductor companies.”</p>
<p>Under the deal, Spreadtrum will create and sell a family of Intel-based system-on-chips. Those chips will be available in the second half of 2015, and they will be sold by both Intel and Spreadtrum.</p>
<p>“The adoption of Intel’s architecture technology will enable us to accelerate the development of mobile SoCs that expand the breadth of our portfolio, benefiting handset makers addressing both China and the global market,” said Leo Li, chairman and CEO of Spreadtrum, in a statement. “We are pleased to embark on collaboration with Intel around these new product offerings.”<br />
The companies expect Intel’s investment to close in early 2015.</p>
<p>Tsinghua Unigroup is a state-owned company affiliated with Tsinghua University. Spreadtrum designs a variety of mobile chip sets for smartphones and other devices. RDA Microelectronics designs wireless chips and radio-frequency semiconductors.</p>

<p>Today, Google announced a new workshop that takes on the unconscious bias in the work place, appropriately titled <a href="https://www.gv.com/lib/unconscious-bias-at-work" target="_blank">Unconscious Bias at Work</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We fill in the blanks because our brains are wired to do that,&#8221; says Google chief technology officer Megan Smith in a promotional video about the workshop. The roughly four-minute video introduces viewers to a host of employees and leaders within Google that are largely not old white men. They all talk about how unconscious bias, mental associations our brains that help make sense of the world, may be preventing the tech sphere from diversifying.</p>
<p>Unconscious bias happens naturally. Our brain creates shortcuts or associations between people, places, and things that happen repeatedly. For instance, if every time you meet your friend Joe for lunch and he&#8217;s late, you&#8217;ll associate Joe with tardiness. &#8220;If we had to remember each circumstance, that would be too much information,&#8221; says Heather Berlin, an assistant professor of neuroscience at Mount Sinai Medical school.</p>
<p>Berlin says that Google&#8217;s initiative to change the way people are treated in the workplace is a good start, but bringing awareness to unconscious biases may not have the desired effect. Google intends for the workshops to make its workforce more open to diversity by focusing on educating employees about their inherent biases.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first step is education; we need to help people identify and understand their biases so that they can start to combat them,&#8221; the <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/09/you-dont-know-what-you-dont-know-how.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> reads.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s motivation here is clear. Like many tech companies, it has a diversity problem &#8212; in that it&#8217;s not diverse. In general, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics suffer from the same plight.</p>
<p>But trying to change those biases and make Google a hospitable environment for diversity may prove more challenging. The notion that you can change unconscious biases consciously is a flawed conceit, according to Berlin. &#8220;Changing [biases] is going to happen outside of awareness. You don&#8217;t say I&#8217;m going to consciously change my subconscious biases. You need to change them unconsciously,&#8221; says Berlin.</p>
<p>The problem with changing biases is a chicken-egg scenario. In order for people to develop associations between women and leadership or African-Americans and engineering, for example, people are going to need to repeatedly see diversity in those roles. The solution to changing biases, Berlin maintains, is as simple as saying there needs to be x number of women in leadership, for example. She points to gay marriage, which has seen an increasing amount of support in recent years. &#8220;It was an anomaly, but now because people see it more, and it&#8217;s more commonplace, the negative associations start to disappear,&#8221; says Berlin.</p>
<p>Only adding more diversity to a workplace isn&#8217;t easy. Many companies have tried using affirmative action to increase diversity with little success. But without changing demographic ratios, erasing biases will be difficult.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no correlation between your conscious biases and unconscious biases. So you can train your conscious biases, but that won&#8217;t reflect on your unconscious biases &#8212; they&#8217;ll show up in other ways,&#8221; says Berlin. She does say that perhaps over a long period of time, if you call someone out on their biases and they react by hiding them, then it will reflect as that bias being changed.</p>
<p>But she also says what Google is doing with these workshops, regardless of its inability to correct the unconscious consciously, is not a bad idea. Still, in order to change biases and achieve a more diverse workforce, ultimately Google just needs to have more diversity in its ranks.</p>
<p>In attempt to shift the statistics, Google has <a href="http://www.google.com/diversity/for-the-future.html" target="_blank">sponsored</a> a number of programs that help give female and minority students access to computer-science opportunities, so that down the road the employment pool itself will be more diverse.</p>
<p>But another step Google could take, says Berlin, is to make the work environment more appealing to the people they want to attract. &#8220;Google is good at this,&#8221; she says. They made work more attractive to young people with games and services. Now the company needs to ask itself what its new target demographic wants. &#8220;You need to make the environment somewhere that these people want to be,&#8221; she says.</p>

<p>To update to the new version, iOS 8.0.2, go to your device&#8217;s Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update, and off you go.</p>

<p>In case you missed <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/09/24/apple-fixes-healthkit-bug-with-release-of-ios-8-01/">Update-gate yesterday</a>, Apple released its first update for iOS 8 since making the new operating system available last week, but it caused widespread issues for people&#8217;s devices. Some folks reported difficulty using their iPhone&#8217;s Touch ID, and others reported interrupted cell service.</p>
<p>Apple quickly pulled the update and directed users to revert back to iOS 8.0.0.</p>
<p>Yesterday&#8217;s update was intended to fix a first set of bugs the OS encountered after its release, namely problems with HealthKit and third-party keyboards, among others.</p>

<p>Today, Movile announced that it has invested $15 million in <a href="http://www.apontador.com.br/" target="_blank">Apontador</a>, a mobile-first service for reviews of local businesses. Movile itself recently raised $55 million in new funding.</p>
<p>Much like Yelp, Apontador is a place where people can contribute reviews of local businesses and services, read reviews written by others, and get a variety of other information about their local small businesses. They can also book reservations, see where their friends are, and receive exclusive access to promotions and deals. Apontador has more than two million users and more than 10 million businesses in its network.</p>
<p>U.S-based Yelp launched its service in Brazil a year ago and is now in two other Latin American countries, Mexico and Argentina. In addition to Brazil, Apontador is also available in Argentina, Mexico, Chile, and Uruguay.</p>
<p>This investment is giving Movile additional grip on the local small businesses market, as it invested in February in iFood, a popular food delivery service in Latin America recently acquired by Just Eat.</p>
<p>Apontador was founded in 2000 and is based in Sao Paolo, Brazil.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment-1545372"  class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:578px;"><div class="image-container single-feed"><img src="http://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/vb_whattothink_cover.png?w=578&#038;h=9999&#038;crop=0" style="max-width: 578px; max-height: 9999px;" alt="What to Think, Ep. 22: New Relic&#8217;s bold&nbsp;second&nbsp;act" class="single-feed" /></div><div class="vb_image_source"><em>Image Credit: VentureBeat</em></div></div><hr/><p>New Relic founder and chief executive Lew Cirne can&#8217;t help but write code in his free time. That&#8217;s how he came up with <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/03/19/new-relic-insights/">the software analytics company&#8217;s Insights service</a>, which lets analysts monitor website and application usage.</p>
<p>And even though he&#8217;s head of <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/04/28/new-relic-brings-in-more-cash-ahead-of-ipo/">an IPO-bound company</a>, Cirne remains plenty active as a developer. Or at least that&#8217;s what he told VentureBeat editor-in-chief Dylan Tweney and staff writer Jordan Novet on this week&#8217;s What to Think podcast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just last Friday, I was running a query in Insights, and I wanted to answer a question I couldn&#8217;t in Insights,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I wanted to see how much revenue we were getting from customers who were using a certain programming language. So I coded up the feature over the weekend, and I checked it in this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just the kind of executive Cirne is. He and others at the company come up with new capabilities, and he relies on top leaders to execute on the plans to make Insights common among business people and also increase adoption of the already widely used New Relic application-performance management service.</p>
<p>Even as he&#8217;s confident of the configuration in place at New Relic, he knows how challenging it is to pull off a second act. He talked about that and several other subjects on the podcast. He even gave a preview of the company&#8217;s second annual <a href="http://futurestack.io/" target="_blank">FutureStack conference</a> in San Francisco on Oct. 8-9. (Hint: It involves OK Go, who will play at the conference&#8217;s kickoff party!) By the way, you can get 50 percent off beta tickets to the conference by going to <a href="http://futurestack.io/?utm_content=home_callout" target="_blank">the FutureStack website</a> and registering with the promo code VentureBeat.</p>
<p>In addition to interviewing Cirne, Dylan and Jordan also talk about:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/09/17/ios-8-apple-opens-up-and-catches-up-to-android-review/">The launch of iOS 8</a>, including new keyboards and a smarter Siri</li>
<li>The <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/09/21/welcome-to-the-strange-upside-down-world-of-yahoo-after-the-alibaba-ipo/">Alibaba IPO</a> and its crazy implications for Yahoo</li>
<li>GamesBeat&#8217;s <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/09/23/oculus-vrs-crescent-bay-prototype-shows-why-vr-still-has-a-long-way-to-go/">Giancarlo Valdes&#8217; impressions</a> of the new <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/09/20/oculus-vr-announces-new-prototype-crescent-bay/">Crescent Bay headset prototype from Oculus Rift</a></li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment-1499620"  class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:578px;"><div class="image-container single-feed"><img src="http://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/nsa-chief-michael-rogers.jpg?w=578&#038;h=9999&#038;crop=0" style="max-width: 578px; max-height: 9999px;" alt="NSA hires a &#8216;risk officer&#8217; to oversee intel missions in a bid to appease a wary&nbsp;public" class="single-feed" /></div><p class="wp-caption-text">Above: NSA chief Michael S. Rogers speaks at Fort Meade.</p><div class="vb_image_source"><em>Image Credit: <a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/ftmeade/14224262765/in/photostream/" target="_blank">ftmeade / Flickr</a></em></div></div><hr/><p>The National Security Agency is getting into the risk management business.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/" target="_blank">NSA</a>, still reeling from the Edward Snowden leaks, named Anne Neuberger, former director of the agency&#8221;s so-called commercial solutions center and an aide to NSA director Admiral Michael S. Rogers, to head up the agency&#8217;s newly created position of &#8216;chief risk officer&#8217; &#8212; the agency&#8217;s first.</p>
<p>&#8220;Enterprise risk management is considered a best practice in many fields and amplifies an organization&#8217;s ability to recognize, integrate, and assess the risk-reward value from multiple perspectives to make more informed, timely, and defensible decisions,&#8221; Rogers said in a posting on the <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/press_room/2014/new_chief_risk_officer.shtml" target="_blank">agency&#8217;s website</a>.</p>
<p>According to the agency:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Ms. Neuberger will work closely alongside all senior leaders at the Agency. In her first year, she will focus on creating and maturing a methodology and processes to assess the various risks across different missions and work toward meeting specific objectives assigned by the director.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Obama, in light of the Snowden debacle, ordered the NSA in June to release its first ever transparency report in an attempt to show the American public that the agency wasn&#8217;t spying on innocent Americans en masse. The Director of National Intelligence (DNI), James Clapper, released the document, which showed the feds had issued 20,000 national security letters in 2013.</p>
<p>Some said the report was a yawner. It was short on specifics, but it did disclose that 90,601 intelligence targets were affected by the secret FISA court orders that enable the NSA to collect intelligence by various means. According to a release at the time, the <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/08/13/nsa-spying-tech-companies/">DNI pointed out</a> that it had declassified &#8220;thousands of pages&#8221; of documents, and would be releasing more every year.</p>
<p>In the new release heralding her appointment, NSA director Rogers said that it was absolutely crucial the agency took a big-picture view of its mission as an important vanguard in sensitive intelligence missions to protect the country.</p>
<p>Mark Jaycox, a legislative analyst with the <a href="https://www.eff.org/" target="_blank">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> who studies the NSA closely, said Neuberger&#8217;s appointment bears watching. But he added that&#8217;s its way too early to tell if she&#8217;ll be an empty suit &#8212; or if she&#8217;ll have the power to provide meaningful oversight.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s encouraging to see the NSA finally have positions like the newly created Risk Officer and the newly created Privacy Office, but this is contingent on these offices being far more open and transparent with the American public than the NSA has been previously,&#8221; Jaycox told VentureBeat Thursday.</p>
<p>Jaycox has been a steadfast critic of the agency, and said that even attempting to appease a skeptical American public with the some kind of oversight was a move in the right direction. But more needs to be done, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;NSA wants to show us that they are making strides towards more privacy protections and a greater self-consciousness of their actions. NSA must do more than create and hire for these positions,&#8221; Jaycox said.</p>
<p>Others were more skeptical.</p>
<p>NSA insiders said that Neuberger&#8217;s appointment might be little more than window dressing.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like James Clapper, the director of national intelligence. He ostensibly has oversight of the entire U.S. intelligence community. But he&#8217;s really a talking head with no authority,&#8221; a former NSA official told VentureBeat.</p>
<p>&#8220;The NSA must empower the positions, the positions must increase transparency by releasing more records to the public, and the positions must have an active voice within NSA to change some of the egregious policies and practices we&#8217;ve seen so far,&#8221; the EFF&#8217;s Jaycox said.</p>

<p>And according to a new report from research firm SiriusDecisions, 83 percent of predictive lead-scoring product users are companies with annual revenue of less than $250 million.</p>
<p>While smaller companies are using these sophisticated marketing technologies to gain a competitive advantage, the technology still has a long way to go; the report reveals that most companies are new to analysis-based lead scoring. Sixty-four percent have been using predictive lead scoring for less than a year.</p>
<p>Predictive scoring systems differ from traditional lead scoring because they don&#8217;t rely on totting up points for each end-customer based on distinct actions.</p>
<p><a href="https://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/predictive-lead-scoring.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/predictive-lead-scoring.jpg?w=558&#038;h=277" alt="predictive-lead-scoring" width="558" height="277" class="alignright wp-image-1561577 size-large" /></a>With older, points-based attribution systems, if a visitor to your website decides to look at the pricing page, you might give them more points than someone who just visits the homepage. If someone downloads a white paper or adds a product to their cart, that person&#8217;s score may gain more points than someone who simply reads a blog post.</p>
<p>Predictive scoring differs in that it looks at contact profile and behavioral information from your customer-relationship management and marketing-automation solutions. Then, by investigating internal data and third-party sources, including Internet sources, these technologies discover patterns in the data that rules-based scoring or gut instinct would simply miss.</p>
<p>The key findings of <a href="https://www.siriusdecisions.com/PredictiveLeadScoring2014.aspx" target="_blank" target="_blank">the report</a>, which takes in data from customers of 6Sense, Fliptop, Infer, Lattice,<br />
Leadspace, Mintigo and Salesfusion, also shows that high-tech companies are more likely to make use of predictive lead scoring.</p>
<p>I asked SiriusDecisions why this might be the case.</p>

<hr />
<p>&#8220;It’s not surprising that 78 percent of B2B [business-to-business] companies using predictive lead scoring platforms are in the high-tech industry,&#8221; Jill Stanek, a research analyst in the technology practice at SiriusDecisions told me in an email. &#8220;One of the primary target audiences for predictive lead scoring vendors are organizations that already have marketing automation in place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marketing automation, of course, is still the &#8216;<a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/06/16/70-players-sub-5-penetration-marketing-automation-just-beginning-to-cross-the-chasm/" target="_blank">new kid on the block</a>&#8216;. Even with 70+ vendors in the category, it is largely the high-tech audience that has bought into the benefits of tools like Pardot, Eloqua, Marketo and Act-On. SiriusDecisions agrees.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our research indicates there is a 65 percent adoption rate of marketing automation platforms in high-tech B2B organizations. Compare that to an 8 percent adoption rate in the manufacturing industry and a 4 percent rate among financial services organizations,&#8221; Stanek wrote.</p>
<p><a href="https://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/pls-extra-data.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/pls-extra-data.jpg?w=558&#038;h=279" alt="PLS-extra-data" width="558" height="279" class="alignright wp-image-1561590 size-large" /></a>So is predictive lead scoring better and more accurate at qualifying leads and opportunities than point-based attribution, or is it that the customer using those systems haven&#8217;t configured them properly?</p>
<p>&#8220;We think that predictive lead scoring is likely to have more value than point-based attribution for a couple reasons,&#8221; Kerry Cunningham, a research director for demand creations strategies at SiriusDecisions, wrote in an email.</p>
<p>&#8220;First, the values &#8212; assigned to attributes or behaviors &#8212; are generated based on their statistical relationship with outcomes of interest, rather than an assumed but unverified relationship between the attribute or behavior and the outcome of interest,&#8221; Cunningham said.</p>
<p>The value of predictive lead scoring is not just in the internal analytics and findings, but also in the data and insight being brought in from third-party sources.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the predictive lead scoring vendors we have evaluated offer their clients a substantial number of data points outside of the client&#8217;s own data stores, some of which are likely to help distinguish strong prospects from weak prospects,&#8221; Cunningham said. &#8220;This is, of course, not the case all the time, but having access to these exogenous attributes can only help sellers identify high likelihood prospects.&#8221;</p>

I never want it to go away and I actually have a bet with a <a href="https://twitter.com/dfreed1" target="_blank">friend</a> that Twitter will be here in 20 years. Twitter was also the first network I added to my <a href="http://socialrank.com/" target="_blank">company.</a></p>
<p>But, Twitter has an onboarding problem.</p>
<p>This problem stems from the simple fact that it is not simple or easy for a new user to learn how to use Twitter to maximum benefit. It takes a lot of work to make Twitter work for you.</p>
<p>I believe Twitter’s growth numbers have slowed in recent years because it has failed at product education and making the sign-up process easy. Twitter is doing a great job monetizing, but it seems a little ridiculous that most people don’t know that if you start a tweet with an @ mention, that only the people who follow you and that handle will see it in their feed (<a href="http://alexstechthoughts.com/post/74181662012/why-not-knowing-to-put-a-period-before-mentions-is-a" target="_blank">here’s a quick fix</a>).</p>
<p>Still, I think there is a solution to its onboarding problem.</p>
<p>One thought before jumping in. Most people I know learned to properly use Twitter from a friend or family member. I learned how to use it when I joined <a href="http://aviary.com/" target="_blank">Aviary</a> in 2010. <a href="http://twitter.com/msg" target="_blank">@msg</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/mayafish" target="_blank">@mayafish</a> said I needed to get on active on Twitter and gave me a Twitter 101 sit down. I taught my wife (<a href="http://twitter.com/liztaub" target="_blank">@liztaub</a>) and my mom (<a href="http://twitter.com/hindytaub" target="_blank">@hindytaub</a>). My mom taught my dad (<a href="http://twitter.com/rubytaub" target="_blank">@rubytaub)</a> and on and on. I’ve heard this type of situation with many others and think Twitter might want to invest a little time and effort in local events. I think it will go a long way with the snowball effect of friends/family teaching friends/family.</p>
<p>Now onto the onboarding process.</p>
<p>First let’s diagnose the main problem. It’s hard for individuals to understand the value in Twitter. From the sign-up process to becoming an active user, they are not building the optimal follow list for their respective interests. This leads them to not use the product often. I think this is fair reasoning. So the solution needs to be:  how can Twitter get new users to a point where they are following enough of the <em>right</em> people to come back and use Twitter as their #1 source of information?</p>
<p>The current sign-up process requires someone to be a self-starter. It’s a major undertaking to find good people to follow. And most regular people are looking for shortcuts on a daily basis. They don’t want to take 30 minutes to follow a few hundred people to have a steady flow of news. They want things done for them and they want it to be good. This general life mentality is at odds with the way Twitter runs its sign-up flow and I think that is where the split of active users versus. non-active users happen. I don’t think Twitter releases total sign ups versus active users but I imagine there is a major discrepancy — more than your normal consumer-facing company. So, how does Twitter solve this pretty big problem?</p>
<p>I’ve thought about it <em>a lot</em>. I’m in a unique situation because I speak to a lot of Twitter users, mostly brands, but a sprinkle of individuals. This is something I do all day, given that I am the co-founder of <a href="http://socialrank.com/" target="_blank">SocialRank</a> (a company that helps brands find out more about their followers on Twitter and pulls them into a central location , sort of like a Hootsuite but for followers).</p>
<p>Before founding SocialRank, I was running the business side of the API platform for payments company <a href="http://dwolla.com/" target="_blank">Dwolla</a> with my now co-founder Michael, who led the technical side.</p>
<p>When we joined Dwolla we knew that the developer portal needed a huge facelift. At the time it was just a bunch of developer docs, which was great, but the problem was non-technical people couldn’t understand how they could leverage the API for their company. A common scenario we saw was that a CEO, head of product, business lead or someone else would come in trying to understand Dwolla and what they could do with the API, but were ultimately discouraged because there was no clear path for them. They didn’t understand the developer documentation, so we lost a potential merchant or partner.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/dwolla.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/dwolla.png?w=300&#038;h=153" alt="dwolla" width="300" height="153" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1561210" /></a></p>
<p>What we did was build an entry point (<a href="http://developers.dwolla.com/" target="_blank">developers.dwolla.com</a>) that had two paths, one for technical people and the other for non-technical folks. You either code or you don’t. If you do code, you go down the coding path and see the developer documentation, helper libraries and more. If you don’t code, you go down the path to see what the API’s capabilities are, how other merchants are using the API, and more. The flow worked out really well, API usage grew and a lot of developer sections copied it because of the success.</p>
<p>So how does this relate to Twitter’s sign-up process? I think there needs to be a path split at the most important point of Twitter’s sign-up process. But, instead of “Code&#8221; and &#8220;Don&#8217;t Code” it is “Build your follow list” and “Build it for me.” Let’s dig in as to how I think it should work.</p>
<p><a href="https://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/twitterstep2.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="http://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/twitterstep2.jpeg?w=300&#038;h=161" alt="twitterstep2" width="300" height="161" class="aligncenter" /></a></p>
<p>Twitter already does a really good job right after sign-up by asking you what your interests are. Once you finish ticking off your interests, though, is where I think they are missing a step. Here is where I would add the split path. One path to build your follow list as normal and one to have it built for you. If you click “Build your follow list,” you go through the existing way of onboarding — this is for those self-starters that naturally figure out how to use this crazy thing they call Twitter.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/builditforme.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="http://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/builditforme.jpeg?w=300&#038;h=161" alt="builditforme" width="300" height="161" /></a></p>
<p>If you click “Build it for me!” that’s when things get interesting. There are a few ways to approach this, but let’s look at three.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/builditforme2.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="http://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/builditforme2.jpeg?w=300&#038;h=161" alt="builditforme2" width="300" height="161" class="aligncenter" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once a person itemizes their interests in the previous step, Twitter can build an optimal follow list of 100–300 accounts that are awesome in these interests. So for example if you selected an interest in sports, tech, and rap and hip hop music you&#8217;d get a list of appropriate people to follow. Your sports list might include everyone from Bill Simmons and Kobe Bryant to a sports writer for the NY Times and A-Rod. For tech, you’d have everyone from Elon Musk, Tim Cook and Fred Wilson to Marc Andreessen, Drew Houston and Marissa Mayer; and for Music you’d have accounts like 50 Cent, Drake, Eminem, Iggy Azalea and Macklemore.</p>
<p>The list should include a combination of popular accounts (i.e. industry-celebrities) as well as people that have a highly engaged follower base. Twitter, you already have this data, so go and make awesome follower lists. Then a new user just has to learn how to perfect that follow list — adding new accounts and removing accounts, and learning what to tweet and how RTs, Favs and @ mentions work.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/buildit3.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="http://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/buildit3.jpeg?w=300&#038;h=161" alt="buildit3" width="300" height="161" /></a></p>
<p>On this next path, Twitter will ask a new user who they want to emulate after they list their interests. Instead of building an optimal follow list for them, suggest a few people that have the same interests as they do and offer them the opportunity to carbon copy someone else&#8217;s follow list.</p>
<p>This is a riskier approach, because follow lists are a combination of interests and personal contacts. So for example if someone had similar interests to me and decided to follow the people I follow in one fell swoop enabled by Twitter, they would get sports, media, tech but also get my friends, family and more. I don&#8217;t follow a lot of friends and family, maybe 20–50 accounts total, but enough to throw people off. It would be interesting if Twitter could do the carbon copy but remove the smaller friend and family accounts. In other words, take the top 75% in terms of follower count or engagement and start someone there.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/createfeed.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="http://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/createfeed.jpeg?w=300&#038;h=161" alt="createfeed" width="300" height="161" class="aligncenter" /></a></p>
<p>The third path uses Twitter Lists. In this path Twitter would take very popular lists and use them as suggested follow lists — not to follow as a traditional list, but to follow the accounts within the list. This is another great starting point as Twitter will have a good sense of who likes what type of lists. Extracting those accounts out and building a follow list for a new user can be a good path to success.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>I believe that if Twitter starts thinking about splitting new users into two types, the ones that want to select their followers for themselves and the ones that want to be told who to follow based on interests, Twitter will be able to A/B test and find optimal paths to activity as well as continue to tinker with the massive amounts of data they have and make the suggestions 100 times better.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment-1561623"  class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:578px;"><div class="image-container single-feed"><img src="http://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-25-at-1-34-47-pm.png?w=578&#038;h=9999&#038;crop=0" style="max-width: 578px; max-height: 9999px;" alt="Spruce Health launches virtual doctor app, raises $2M&nbsp;seed&nbsp;round" class="single-feed" /></div><div class="vb_image_source"><em>Image Credit: Spruce Health</em></div></div><hr/><p dir="ltr">Consumers, health providers, and insurers are just now getting comfortable with the idea that many types of face-to-face doctor visits can be replaced with less expensive virtual visits.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A new telemedicine app called Spruce launched today in the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id908860329" target="_blank" target="_blank">App Store</a>, with an Android app coming soon. The app connects users with a board-certified physician for the remote diagnosis and treatment of common medical conditions. Each visit costs $40, the majority of which goes to the physician, <a href="https://www.sprucehealth.com/" target="_blank">Spruce Health</a> CEO Ray Bradford tells VentureBeat.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At launch the Spruce app will be used for treating people with acne problems. Why acne? Because a surprising number of people suffer from it, and not just teenagers. Bradford says half of all women in their 20s and 30s have acne.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-12x.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-12x.png?w=297&#038;h=600" alt="screen-1@2x" width="297" height="600" class="alignright size-large wp-image-1561624" /></a>It&#8217;s also really hard to get an appointment with a dermatologist to treat the problem. The average wait time is 30 days for an in-person visit. As many as 80 percent of acne sufferers end up never talking to a doctor about it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of pent-up demand to see a dermatologist,&#8221; Bradford says.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here&#8217;s how the Spruce app works. First, the user shares photos and medical information with a board-certified dermatologist, and within 24 hours a dermatologist reviews the information and sends a personalized treatment plan back to the user&#8217;s phone. A prescription is sent to the user&#8217;s pharmacy if needed. Importantly, the user can always refer to the app for exact aftercare instructions, Bradford says.</p>
<p dir="ltr">San Francisco-based Spruce says it worked closely with top board­-certified dermatologists to understand their approach and workflows for treating patients with acne, and designed software to address frustrations both patients and doctors experience.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bradford would not divulge the size of the network of dermatologists that are doing the virtual consults, but he stresses that there are enough of them to meet the 24-hour turnaround time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Spruce intends to offer other types of virtual doctor consults in the future.</p>
<div>
<p dir="ltr">Spruce was founded by Bradford last year. The company has so far raised a $2 million round of seed funding led by Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, Baseline Ventures, and Cowboy Ventures.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p></div><p>I&#8217;m not buying an iPhone 6 because I&#8217;m cheap. I don&#8217;t want to lock myself into a two-year contract, and I&#8217;m unwilling to spend <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/buy-iphone/iphone6" target="_blank">$650 or more</a> for an off-contract phone that I&#8217;ll probably want to replace in a year, or at the most two years, anyway.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not buying an iPhone 6 because <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/09/23/watch-video-proof-of-iphone-6-plus-serious-bending-issue-a-reason-to-wait-before-buying/">it will bend</a> when I put it in the back pocket of my skinny jeans.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not buying an iPhone 6 because the <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/09/24/apple-fixes-healthkit-bug-with-release-of-ios-8-01/">latest version of the iPhone operating system, iOS 8.0.1</a>, makes it so TouchID doesn&#8217;t work on some phones and stops cellular service from working on others.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not buying an iPhone 6 because the previous version, <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/09/17/apple-healthkit-apps-are-on-hold-due-to-last-minute-problems/">iOS 8.0, had bugs in HealthKit,</a> preventing fitness and health apps from communicating with Apple&#8217;s new cloud-based health data interchange service.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not buying an iPhone 6 because I don&#8217;t want to be a beta tester.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not buying an iPhone 6 because Android has had features like swipe-to-delete on email messages and customizable keyboards for, what, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LADbible/photos/a.200542726659592.50788.199098633470668/944858602227997/?type=1&amp;theater" target="_blank">four years now</a>?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not buying an iPhone 6 because I&#8217;m opposed to the closed system that Apple enforces, making it so you can only use its <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/09/17/ios-8-apple-opens-up-and-catches-up-to-android-review/">Continuity feature with OS X</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not buying an iPhone 6 because I have <a href="http://gizmodo.com/what-android-fragmentation-looks-like-its-growing-1624662310" target="_blank">so many more choices with Android</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not buying an iPhone 6 because in the future, anyone who wants to have an <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/09/09/apple-shows-off-its-long-awaited-apple-watch-smartwatch/">Apple Watch</a> will also need an iPhone because the watch won&#8217;t work by itself. <a href="http://www.xda-developers.com/android/pair-your-samsung-galaxy-gear-with-non-samsung-devices/" target="_blank">Just like the Samsung Galaxy Gear watch</a>. And you know I&#8217;m dorky enough to <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/09/15/apple-has-been-developing-the-apple-watch-for-at-least-4-years/">wear an iPod nano on my wrist</a>, so I&#8217;ll probably wind up wearing an Apple Watch too. But I don&#8217;t have to like it!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not buying an iPhone 6 because <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/10/31/android-captures-record-81-global-market-share-windows-phone-is-fastest-growing/">Android is winning the market share battle</a>, and that trend isn&#8217;t going to change any time soon.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not buying an iPhone 6 because I don&#8217;t want to <a href="http://www.techradar.com/us/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/the-gross-truth-behind-the-iphone-launch-line-1266338" target="_blank">stand in line</a>. Plus, I heard those lines were filled with people <a href="http://time.com/3423883/iphone-6-china/" target="_blank">buying phones for the &#8220;Chinese mafia.&#8221;</a> (Not true, by the way, but I&#8217;m still not waiting in line, even if those are just regular people.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not buying an iPhone 6 because my iPhone 4 works just fine. And you should use a phone until it wears out, not buy a new one every year. I&#8217;m also waiting to upgrade my 2001 Honda Accord until it stops running.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not buying an iPhone 6 because if you&#8217;re a really good customer on AT&amp;T, the company rewards you by not letting you buy the new model until late next year. What other business works that way?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not buying an iPhone 6 because it doesn&#8217;t feel like as big of a leap as the iPhone 5S last year.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not buying an iPhone 6 because the new models are just too big and dorky and uncomfortable in my delicate lady hands. And that camera on the 6 Plus sticks out of the back.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not buying an iPhone 6 because Tim Cook will never live up to the legacy of his old boss, the late Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not buying an iPhone 6 because Apple is a huge polluter. Despite the fact that it has eliminated lots of toxic chemicals and is taking steps to make its stores and its new headquarters as green as possible, it still runs data centers that use coal-powered electricity, and its manufacturing facilities in China are probably big polluters too, who knows.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not buying an iPhone 6 because I&#8217;m not one of the sheeple.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not buying an iPhone 6 because I kind of like feeling superior, standing on the outside and looking in at a party that I don&#8217;t really want to join anyway.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not buying an iPhone 6 because I don&#8217;t trust Apple&#8217;s security, since the NSA has a program designed to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2013/12/30/the-nsa-reportedly-has-total-access-to-your-iphone/" target="_blank">make the iPhone completely accessible</a> to its secret agents. <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/06/nsa-bug-iphone/" target="_blank">Even if it is turned off</a>. Android? Windows Phone? BlackBerry? I&#8217;m pretty sure those are safe from the NSA.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not buying an iPhone 6 because for me, phones are basically tools to get a job done, and that job is staying in touch with my reporters and my editors and my boss and the news. And while I appreciate a well-crafted, well-designed product as much as the next gadget geek, I&#8217;m not in a rush to get the latest gadget just for its own sake, particularly when the one I&#8217;ve got now is doing that job just fine.</p>

Updated at 4:04 p.m. with a statement from Flipboard.<br />
</em></p>
<p>Digital magazine startup Flipboard has decided to stop shafting Windows Phone users by releasing a <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/flipboard/e5723a43-42c8-4e25-b322-115f07bd44f1" target="_blank" target="_blank">new app</a> that&#8217;s available to <em>some</em> users today.</p>
<p>Apparently the company decided to add a listing in the Windows Phone store last week, and previously <a href="http://www.winbeta.org/news/flipboard-windows-phone-listed-windows-phone-store-cant-be-installed-just-yet" target="_blank" target="_blank">wasn&#8217;t allowing anyone to install it</a>, according to a <a href="https://twitter.com/Flipboard/status/515219350505402369" target="_blank" target="_blank">tweet</a> from Flipboard. As of today, however, some are <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/25/6845063/flipboard-windows-phone-features" target="_blank" target="_blank">reporting</a> that they have been able to install the app, which still has a few bugs that haven&#8217;t been fixed.</p>
<div class="embed-twitter">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="500">
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Sokreter" target="_blank">@Sokreter</a> This is not the official release. That was an early, incomplete build staged on the store as a placeholder. We may have removed it</p>
<p>&mdash; Flipboard (@Flipboard) <a href="https://twitter.com/Flipboard/status/515219350505402369" target="_blank">September 25, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>A Windows Phone app for Flipboard was first announced nearly a year ago, meaning people have been waiting for it for a while now. Flipboard tells VentureBeat a final version is coming soon, and offered the following explanation for the current incomplete version:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have been working with the team at Microsoft to launch on the new phones, including the Lumia 830 and other high-end phones. We had staged Flipboard in the Windows Phone store in preparation for the launch, but had wanted to fix a few bugs before officially releasing. That said, we do expect to officially be live in the Windows Store and announce Flipboard for Windows Phones very soon. The placeholder lets us test the app as we prepare for an upcoming launch as well as fix some bugs of the preloaded version of Flipboard.</p></blockquote>
<p>One big thing to note about this version is that it doesn&#8217;t contain the ability to navigate through articles and pages by &#8220;<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/25/6845063/flipboard-windows-phone-features" target="_blank" target="_blank">flipping</a>,&#8221; which is strange considering that Flipboard is named after that particular &#8220;flip&#8221; UX effect.</p>
<p>The flipping UX effect is similar to flipping a paper page. Half the screen on Flipboard folds onto itself to reveal the following page. For tablets, the &#8220;flip&#8221; is done horizontally or side-to-side (<a href="https://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/flipboard-tablet-flip.png" target="_blank" target="_blank">visual reference</a>), while the iPhone version &#8220;flips&#8221; half the page vertically or from top-to-bottom when navigating to the following page (<a href="https://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/flipboard-iphone-flip.png" target="_blank" target="_blank">visual reference</a>).</p>
<p>Instead of flipping, Flipboard for Windows Phone app just slides the full page over to reveal the following page &#8212; sort of like when you&#8217;re browsing photos on your smartphone.(Thankfully, Flipboard did not feel compelled to rename the app &#8220;Slideboard.&#8221;) Other than the lack of flipping, the app contains nearly all the other features available on Flipboard for Android and iOS.

<p>More specifically, the FAA says it &#8220;has granted regulatory exemptions to six aerial photo and video production companies. According the the FAA, this is &#8220;the first step to allowing the film and television industry the use of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) in the National Airspace System.&#8221;</p>
<p>A prior FAA ruling banned the commercial use of drones, though the agency has been increasingly considering exceptions because a number of companies (like <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/12/01/amazons-next-big-innovation-prime-air-drones-for-30-minute-deliveries/">Amazon</a>) are interested in operating drones commercially.</p>
<p>The Motion Picture Association of America has been lobbying for exemptions to the ban, so production companies can use drones for filming aerial shots rather than using helicopters and airplanes. U.S. production companies already use camera-mounted drones, but only on sets in countries where laws are more drone-tolerant.</p>
<p>The exemption doesn&#8217;t mean the film industry won&#8217;t have to mitigate the risks involved in using drones, says Jesse Kallman, Head of Business Development and Regulatory Affairs at drone platform company Airware. &#8220;Now that the MPAA and its associated operators have been exempted from certain rules, they must apply for operational approval to operate in specific areas with given aircraft and operators,&#8221; he says in a <a href="http://blog.airware.com/" target="_blank">blog post</a>. This could manifest as additional rules; film production crews may only be allowed to have drones on closed sets, for example.</p>
<p>Many see the FAA granting an exemption to the film industry as an early indication that the agency will open up drone use more broadly.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=venturebeat.com&#038;blog=342986&#038;post=1561481&#038;subd=venturebeat&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><div class="post-boilerplate boilerplate-after"><hr />

<p>In addition to founders such as Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk making an appearance, <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/style/article/Burning-Man-becomes-a-hot-spot-for-tech-titans-4756482.php" target="_blank">there have reports</a> that the tech elite used the annual Nevada desert experimental art and rave-fest to recruit talent, but it was never made public.</p>
<p>In conversation with Stephen Colbert in promoting his new book, &#8220;How Google Works,&#8221; CEO Eric Schmidt regaled the crowd with the beginnings of his relationship with his co-founders.</p>
<p>Back in 2001, when Google was nothing more than big ideas and 150 employees, Sergey Brin and Larry Page started courting the long-time tech CEO. But they did so in their unorthodox way, with multiple interviews and invitations to ski and sky-dive.</p>
<p>Schmidt, however, says he refused their advances.</p>
<p>“What were you supposed to do?” asked Colbert. “Sky dive or bungee jump?”<br />
“We all went to Burning Man together,” Schmidt said. “There’s a rule at Burning Man. No pictures.”</p>
<p>The fact that the head of a multi-billion dollar company would admit this in public is more than a fun exercise in storytelling. Burning Man is a unique place, and it speaks volumes about the values of influential tech companies.</p>
<p>On a typical day at Burning Man, a participant may imbibe all sorts of drugs, dance until the sunrise, join a naked bike ride, explore multi-story interactive art, or attend a lecture on yoga.</p>
<p>The kinds of people who attend Burning Man tend to be young liberals who want to see the world become a more open and innovative place. They&#8217;re not shy about privacy.</p>
<p>So when we look at the kinds of things Google does, with an emphasis on real name policies or aspirations to make all <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/19/larry-pages-wish-to-make-all-health-data-public-has-big-benefits-and-big-risks/" target="_blank">personal health data public</a>, it&#8217;s easy to see how this comes from the personality of someone who attends Burning Man.<br />
The more we understand about the personalities of the influential tech elite, the better we can foresee how they want to change the world.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=venturebeat.com&#038;blog=342986&#038;post=1561501&#038;subd=venturebeat&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><div class="post-boilerplate boilerplate-after"><hr />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment-737023"  class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:578px;"><div class="image-container single-feed"><img src="http://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/drones.jpg?w=578&#038;h=9999&#038;crop=0" style="max-width: 578px; max-height: 9999px;" alt="DHL&#8217;s &#8216;drug drones&#8217; might be useful in U.S.&nbsp;heathcare" class="single-feed" /></div><div class="vb_image_source"><em>Image Credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/69214385@N04/8725078749/sizes/c/in/photostream/">Don McCullough/Flickr</a></em></div></div><hr/><p>News yesterday that German shipping giant DHL has <a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/deutsche-post-dhl-to-deliver-medicine-via-drone-1411576151?mod=trending_now_2" target="_blank">caught drone fever</a> is uninteresting until you learn what DHL&#8217;s drones will be delivering: drugs &#8212; to a remote island in the North Sea. Right now it&#8217;s just a month-long feasibility project, but if successful and useful, it could be extended. It&#8217;s a compelling use case.</p>
<p>The drones will carry medications from the German coastal town of Norddeich to the small island of Juist 7.5 miles away, if the weather is favorable. A pilot on the ground will keep an eye on the flights, alerting an air traffic control center if any problems arise.</p>
<p>Regulators have been wary about the use, or even the testing, of drones. Amazon and Google say it may take years to demonstrate that drones can harmlessly fly over populated areas. That&#8217;s why Google tested its drones in the Australian outback, and Amazon performed some of its drone tests in Canada.</p>
<p>Right now <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/07/11/amazon-seeks-approval-to-test-prime-air-drone-deliveries-in-30-minutes-or-less/">Amazon</a> and <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/08/28/dont-act-surprised-google-has-a-drone-delivery-program/">Google</a> are considering using drones to decrease the time between product order and product enjoyment. Regulators might look more favorably on drone programs that deliver vital products like medications.</p>
<p>Could drones play a part in fixing the hugely inefficient healthcare delivery system in the U.S.? Maybe.</p>
<p>One of the key themes in healthcare reform is to incentivize providers to keep tabs on patients and intervene before they need to utilize expensive last-resort services like emergency room visits. Healthcare providers need to make sure patients actually fill the prescriptions that keep them healthy. Many don&#8217;t, and this costs the system billions of dollars each year.</p>
<p>In addition, many are physically unable to fill their prescriptions: Rural pharmacies have been closing down by the thousands during the last five years because of high overhead, including the cost of paying a licensed local pharmacist.</p>
<p>Then there are drug-by-mail programs, which have become common in the U.S., but many patients either cannot access that service or simply don&#8217;t use it.</p>
<p>But drones may be useful to quickly deliver medications to remote patients, especially not-so-healthy ones who need special drugs to treat unexpected problems that crop up.</p>
<p>As telemedicine, which allows practitioners to stay connected with patients who live far from clinics and hospitals, continues to become mainstream, it will likely be a common method of dispensing care in coming years. Drones are a logical extension of telemedicine.</p>
<p>Use of the technology is not far-fetched. We&#8217;ve seen numerous significant venture capital raises by drone startups in recent months (see <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/07/16/aerial-drone-maker-airphrame-secures-4-2m-in-startup-funding/">Airphrame</a>, see <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/07/23/startup-airware-raises-25m-to-help-bring-more-commercial-drones-to-market/">Airware</a>), suggesting that those investors are confident that regulators will eventually make peace with the technology.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SPONSORED POST</p><div id="attachment-593125"  class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:578px;"><div class="image-container single-feed"><img src="http://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/anonymous-head.jpg?w=578&#038;h=9999&#038;crop=0" style="max-width: 578px; max-height: 9999px;" alt="How to turn unknown shoppers into known customers with&nbsp;personalization" class="single-feed" /></div><div class="vb_image_source"><em>Image Credit: http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-106771871/stock-photo-businessman-with-a-paper-bag-on-head.html</em></div></div><hr/><p><em>This sponsored post is produced by Gigya. </em></p>
<p>Lets face it: Consumers are overwhelmingly inundated with new products and brands each day. As conflicting brand messages flood across consumers’ screens and minds, personalization continues to play a growing role in creating the types of meaningful, memorable user experiences that drive conversions.</p>
<p>However, as a marketer, you know all too well that the question of how to effectively implement a marketing strategy that incorporates relevance and personalization is far from simple.</p>
<h3>Your Four-Step Path to Personalization</h3>
<p>To start building engaging user experiences, you’ll need to craft a personalization strategy and adopt the right tools to responsibly and collect and apply consumer data to your brand experience. <a href="http://info.gigya.com/ecom-wp.html" target="_blank">This eBook</a> lays out the following four steps to personalized brand experiences, citing real-life examples as inspiration:</p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b> <b>Establish Consumer Identity</b> &#8211; An identity-based view of consumers enables your brand to break demographic stereotypes and hypothetical personas to personalize user experiences based on consumers’ individual interests, actions, and behaviors. Social login is a great solution for <a href="http://www.gigya.com/social-login/" target="_blank">reducing barriers to registration</a> and capturing rich customer data in a safe, unobtrusive way.</p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b> <b>Get a Single Customer View</b> &#8211; Break down data silos across your organization by implementing a master database that offers a <a href="http://www.gigya.com/identity-storage/" target="_blank">single view of your audience.</a> This database should have the ability to reconcile and index both structured (email, name, etc.) and unstructured (relationships, Facebook likes, etc.) data from multiple sources in real-time.</p>
<p><b>Step 3:</b> <b>Reconcile Profile &amp; Behavioral Data</b> &#8211; A single customer view enables you to tie consumer profile data, such as relationships, birthdays, and interests, to on-site behavioral data, such as discount redemptions and checkouts. This lets you identify and tailor your messaging to speak to the types of characteristics and behaviors that drive revenue and KPIs for your business.</p>
<p><b>Step 4:</b> <b>Turn Data into Action</b> &#8211; Offer marketers an actionable view of end-user data housed within your consumer identity database via a <a href="http://www.gigya.com/consumer-insights/" target="_blank">user-friendly, web-based dashboard.</a> Give business leaders the power to easily run queries based on any number of user attributes and strategically build custom audience segments to reach consumers with relevance at scale.</p>

<p>Today, Instagram announced you can now use your phone&#8217;s front camera to shoot videos with its Hyperlapse app. The company has released a new update for Hyperlapse that activates this feature.</p>
<p>In the Help section of Hyperlapse&#8217;s website, the company <a href="https://help.instagram.com/help/hyperlapse/632401936874827" target="_blank">writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>You can use your front-facing camera to shoot a video of yourself. Tap [the front-camera button] to switch the camera to front-facing (“selfielapse”) and if you change your mind, tap it again to return to regular Hyperlapse.

The answer may lay south.</p>
<p>Beth Kindig, the senior manager of developer relations at the global mobile ad network <a href="http://www.vserv.com/" target="_blank">Vserv.mobi</a>, has a good idea based on data from hundreds of millions of mobile games. At our <a href="http://events.venturebeat.com/event/gamesbeat2014/#custom_1506">GamesBeat University</a> track at GamesBeat 2014, she talked about the rate of growth in game markets such as Japan, Brazil, India, Thailand, Taiwan, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>In relation to China, India has lots of downloads and users. But it&#8217;s lacking in revenue, coming in at No. 21 worldwide with $100 million in revenue. Still, it&#8217;s worth thinking about, as it will hit sales of 213 million in smartphone sales in 2014 alone. But India is only starting to get operator billing. Before China had operator billing, it also was a $100 million market. <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/08/04/chinas-mobile-game-market-to-grow-a-scorching-93-to-2-9b-in-2014/">Now it&#8217;s a $2.9 billion market</a>, according to market researchers Niko Partners.</p>
<p>&#8220;Each of these elements are like a tectonic plate,&#8221; Kindig said. &#8220;If you can crack this problem, you can create this huge shift.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kindig has suggestions about how to deal with mobile payments in places like Brazil.</p>
<p>Kindig just moved on to a new position at Vungle. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.vserv.com/think-know-next-mobile-gaming-market/" target="_blank">Kindig&#8217;s full presentation in video</a> at GamesBeat University, our track for gaming tips and tricks at <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/09/17/all-the-stories-from-gamesbeat-2014/">GamesBeat 2014</a>.</p>

The new Group feature for Microsoft&#8217;s online services could help them collaborate more efficiently.</p>
<p>Announced in a <a href="http://blogs.office.com/2014/09/25/delivering-first-chapter-groups-office-365/" target="_blank">blog post</a> today, Groups can show employees at a glance all the different groups existing inside the company, without getting permission. Groups have dedicated inboxes, shared calendars, a hub for common files, and a way to comment on files without going to a different app.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re launching Groups in stages starting today,&#8221; Jared Spataro, general manager of enterprise social at Microsoft, wrote in the blog post. &#8220;In this initial phase, Groups will show up within the web experiences of Office 365 email and calendar and OneDrive for Business. In upcoming phases, we will add Yammer and Lync to the Groups experience to help you do even more.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the most part, Groups might not sound like a huge advancement, drawing as it does on several Microsoft tools that have existed for years, like file sharing and email. But Groups does acknowledge how people really work, at least sometimes. And that position aligns well with Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella&#8217;s vision for the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;At our core, Microsoft is the productivity and platform company for the mobile-first and cloud-first world,&#8221; Nadella wrote in <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/07/10/microsoft-productivity-platform-nadella/">a memo to employees</a> in July.</p>
<p>And yes, you will be able to access Groups features on mobile devices.</p>

We apologize for the error.</em></p>
<p>Today Yahoo released its <a href="https://transparency.yahoo.com/" target="_blank">third transparency report</a>, revealing 18,594 government data requests impacting 30,511 users.</p>
<p>The numbers above do not include secret requests approved by the FISA court. Yahoo details that from July 1, 2013, to December 31, 2013, it received between 0 and 1998 FISA requests for user data, affecting up to 54,997 users (including national security letters). Yahoo&#8217;s latest FISA data requests figure mirrors stats reported by the company from January 1, 2013 to June 30, 2013. However, in the first half of 2013 Yahoo reported up to 32,997 affected accounts, contrasting the 54,997 figure above.</p>
<p>If these stats strike you as vague, that&#8217;s intentional. And it&#8217;s troubling that the number of accounts potentially affected by FISA requests grew significantly over the course of a single period.</p>
<p>Overall, 41 percent of accounts affected by <a href="https://transparency.yahoo.com/government-data-requests/index.htm" target="_blank">government data requests</a> came from requests made by the U.S. government.</p>
<p>Yahoo shares that it received <a href="https://transparency.yahoo.com/government-removal-requests/index.htm" target="_blank">5 content removal requests</a>, three of which came from the U.S. government. Yahoo shares that these removal requests can occur &#8220;due to allegations of defamation, impersonation, or harassment, while others are due to allegations that the content violates local laws prohibiting hate speech or adult content.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=venturebeat.com&#038;blog=342986&#038;post=1561343&#038;subd=venturebeat&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><br /><br /><p id="company-4fc099f514edf6218502260a">						<p>

<p>      The Corporate Venture &amp; Innovation Initiative (CVI²) announced today the       release of the <i>Thelander CVI² 2014 CVC Compensation Report</i>. The       report is the most comprehensive effort to provide cross-industry       external benchmarks for corporate venture capital (CVC) compensation       levels and structures at Global 2000 companies. The 2014 survey provides       data from more than 100 CVC execs representing more than 80 leading       programs.    </p>
<p>      According to CVI² charter member and pioneering industry tracker and       media company Global Corporate Venturing, today worldwide there are more       than 1100 corporations with corporate venture programs, more than 475 of       those having formed since the beginning of 2010.    </p>
<p>      &#8220;Corporate venture capital programs now extend across a broad spectrum       of industries and have become an important element in the innovation       strategies of Global 2000 companies and compensation is critical for       successful implementation of such a program,&#8221; said Mark Radcliffe,       partner at DLA Piper, the global law firm and co-founder of the CVI²       alliance.    </p>
<p>      Companies use corporate venture capital as a compelling means to drive       outside-in (&#8216;open&#8217;) innovation for: access to new and disruptive       technologies, the development of new business models and participation       in emerging markets, all of which may provide meaningful contributions       to corporate growth. As the traditional venture capital industry       continues to consolidate, CVCs are also playing an increasingly       prominent role in venture commercialization &#8211; filling financing gaps,       providing operational and market development support and enabling scale       through M&amp;A and other forms of investment partnerships and       collaborations.    </p>
<p>      &#8220;In order to accelerate meaningful corporate and market impact, many       corporations are expanding their CVC unit mandates to include       traditional minority investments, majority equity investment more       consistent with Growth PE, M&amp;A and internal commercial piloting and       incubation programs; and compensation structures need to keep pace with       these changes,&#8221; said Heidi Mason, managing partner of Bell Mason Group       and co-founder of CVI².    </p>
<p>      The <i>Thelander-CVI² 2014 CVC Compensation Report </i>found that 71%       percent of corporate venture executives believe that the compensation       structure at their company does not adequately compensate them nor       accurately reflect the realities of their positions. The survey also       found that corporate venture leaders also have generally short tenures       in their position &#8212; nearly 40 percent have been in their position less       than two years.    </p>
<p>      The report ties those short tenures to (a) the large number of younger       units, (b) competition and compensation structures, and (c) turn-over in       the chief executive and chief financial officer roles to which the       position commonly reports. Nearly half of corporate venture executives       said they had experienced a CEO and/or CFO change in their parent       company in the previous three years.    </p>
<p>      Unlike financial venture capitalists, the bonus structure for corporate       venture almost always (97%) included cash compensation rather than       &#8220;carry&#8221; in the success of the portfolio companies. In addition, about       half of corporate venture capitalists received awards of options or       shares in the parent company.    </p>
<p>      &#8220;We were interested to see that average CVC compensation numbers from       2013 to 2014 remained consistent even as numbers of participants       doubled. This could be an early indicator of standardization happening       in the bands of compensation for CVC team positions,&#8221; said Tracy Isacke,       Managing Director, Corporate Venture Capital at CVI2 charter member       Silicon Valley Bank.    </p>
<p>      The <i>Thelander-CVI² 2014 CVC Compensation Report</i> examines the       different types of organizational and reporting structures of venture       funding at global corporations, as well as the salary and compensation       packages of industry executives. Previously, most of the information on       corporate venture compensation and structure has been anecdotal or       opinion based. With the Thelander-CVI² 2014 CVC Compensation Report, the       market realities are much clearer, and the decisions for executive       management and corporate boards can be more informed.    </p>
<p>      &#8220;The combination of all our compensation reports, covering PE/VC,       private companies, and CVC, provides the largest overview and most       current perspective on the entire investment industry. Our ability to       compare and contrast compensation practices as well as focus on trends       across sectors is the top resource for the investment community and       their portfolio companies,&#8221; said Jody Thelander, President &amp; CEO,       J.Thelander Consulting.    </p>
<p>      The survey was conducted by compensation specialists at J. Thelander       Consulting in partnership with the Corporate Venture &amp; Innovation       Initiative (CVI²), a consortium of thought leading advisory service       firms, dedicated to serving the corporate venturing and innovation       industry. It was supported by trade associations NCVA, EVCA, Innovator&#8217;s       Huddle and conference organizer IBF.    </p>

</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=venturebeat.com&#038;blog=342986&#038;post=1561041&#038;subd=venturebeat&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment-1561044"  class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:578px;"><div class="image-container single-feed"><img src="http://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/byqzbqtciaa8-bl-1.jpg?w=578&#038;h=9999&#038;crop=0" style="max-width: 578px; max-height: 9999px;" alt="How the tech elite teach Stanford students to build billion-dollar companies (in&nbsp;11&nbsp;quotes)" class="single-feed" /></div><div class="vb_image_source"><em>Image Credit: <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/514563767250604032/photo/1" target="_blank">Sam Altman, Twitter</a></em></div></div><hr/><p>Stanford is offering a class in startups taught by some of the most successful tech founders in the valley. The class was packed on day one, as famed investor Sam Altman revealed some of the secrets he teaches aspiring startups at incubator Y Combinator. You can watch the full lecture with Altman and Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz below. Through the semester, various guest lecturers who have built or seeded billion dollar companies will be added online.</p>
<p>The whole first lecture is worth watching, whether you&#8217;re itching to start your own company or just interested in tech culture.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='560' height='315' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/CBYhVcO4WgI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>For your convenience, though, here&#8217;s the best advice in 11 quotes.</p>
<p><strong>1. &#8220;You should never start a startup just for doing so. There are much easier ways to get rich &#8230; the specific passion should come first and the startup, second.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Both Altman and Moskovitz make a compelling case that startups are a very poor strategy for making money. Moskovitz shows a graph of how it&#8217;s far more likely that a smart person can be employee 100 at a billion dollar company and make just as much (if not more) than someone who starts their own company</p>
<p><a href="http://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-24-at-10-56-21-pm.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-24-at-10-56-21-pm.png?w=558&#038;h=347" alt="Screen Shot 2014-09-24 at 10.56.21 PM" width="558" height="347" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1561042" /></a></p>
<p>In Silicon Valley there are much quicker paths to becoming a millionaire than risking 10 years of your life on an unproven idea.</p>
<p><strong>2. &#8220;The world needs you to do it. If it&#8217;s not something the world needs, go do something the world needs.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Moskovitz echos the common theme that startup founders should be inescapably passionate about their idea. Unless you feel you cannot live without building this product, you may not live through your company&#8217;s hard times, and you definitely won&#8217;t be able to recruit employees to follow you.</p>
<p><strong>3. &#8220;Most great companies start with a great idea, not a pivot &#8230; if you look at the track record of pivots, they don&#8217;t become big companies.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Altman dispels the myth that startup founders can go into a company with a mediocre idea and then evolve into a polished winner. He says that major pivots nearly always fail. And successful pivots are usually a change in direction closer to the problem that the founders meant to solve initially.</p>
<p><strong>4. &#8220;The idea should come first, and the startup second &#8230; if you have several ideas that all seem pretty good, work on the one that you think about most often, when you&#8217;re not trying to think about work.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>I once heard that LinkedIn&#8217;s Reid Hoffman asked his friends about a few ideas and his friends advised him on LinkedIn (good call!). In other words, it&#8217;s not uncommon to want to solve many problems. But solve the one that you can&#8217;t stop thinking about.</p>
<p><strong>5. &#8220;You need a market that&#8217;s going to be big in 10 years &#8230; this is one of the biggest systematic mistakes that investors make, they think of the growth of the startup itself, they don&#8217;t think about the growth of the market.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Peter Thiel advises companies to try to create a monopoly. Own an entire sector. The only way to become a rich monopoly is to own the largest chunk of a sector that will be big in 5-10 years.</p>
<p><strong>6. &#8220;In general, it&#8217;s best if you build something that you yourself need &#8230; you&#8217;ll understand it better than if you have to understand it by talking to a customer.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>This one is self-evident, if contentious. Silicon Valley gets a lot of guff for creating products for privileged yuppies. Altman seems to think this is the only way a good startup can begin.</p>
<p><strong>7. &#8220;If it takes more than a sentence to explain what you&#8217;re doing, it&#8217;s almost always a sign that it&#8217;s too complicated.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Keep it simple, stupid.</p>
<p><strong>8. &#8220;More important [to success] than any particular startup is getting to know a lot of potential co-founders.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Be a social butterfly. It&#8217;s hard to run a startup without any founding friends. Facebook, Paypal, and Google all had co-founders with very good relations, and many of them met through socializing.</p>
<p><strong>9. &#8220;When really successful startup founders tell the story of their early days, it&#8217;s almost always sitting in front of the computer working on their product or talking to customers. That&#8217;s pretty much all the time. They do little else.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p>In the early days, Altman advises founders not to hire a press team or sales reps. A good founder does everything him or herself so he or she can understand the product and how the customers want it to be better. I&#8217;m always surprised at how serial entrepreneurs with one previous exit under their belt act when they begin a new company: They can afford all the support they need, but they&#8217;ll take all the time in the world to hear about a customer complaint.</p>
<p><strong>10. &#8220;It&#8217;s better to build something that a small number of users love than a large number of users like.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>To grow a company by word of mouth, customers need to love the product. Like doesn&#8217;t cut it.</p>
<p><strong>11. &#8220;The best ideas often look terrible at the beginning &#8230; the truly good ideas, don&#8217;t seem like they&#8217;re worth stealing.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Obvious and compelling ideas are most likely already being built by large companies. Startups thrive in the spaces that seem crazy but are secretly brilliant.</p>
<p>This all seems like some great advice and it&#8217;s only the first lecture.

<p>AT&amp;T announced its plans to take over the satellite TV company back in May, with the deal being <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/05/18/att-plans-to-acquire-directv-for-48-5b/" target="_blank">worth $48.5 billion</a>, as VentureBeat previously reported. The move would give AT&amp;T a nationwide TV service that could theoretically compete with the likes of Netflix, Hulu, and others while also giving the telecom another service to bundle with its wireless data, broadband Internet, and phone services.</p>
<p>DirecTV said 99 percent of its shareholders voted in favor of the AT&amp;T deal, which still needs federal regulatory approval before becoming official. The companies expect the deal to gain that approval by early 2015, but that might be wishful thinking based on the number of major decisions the Federal Communications Commission still has to deal will as well as the amount of <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/05/19/why-you-should-hate-the-att-directv-merger/" target="_blank">negative attention</a> the deal is getting from critics.</p>

<hr />
<p>AT&amp;T already operates its own TV service, Uverse, but it is restricted to select regions across the country and not available everywhere like DirecTV. For this reason, AT&amp;T argues, a merger would not reduce the amount of competition in the pay-TV space. It&#8217;s a flimsy argument, and it certainly doesn&#8217;t help that the FCC is also in the middle of determining whether to approve a merger from Comcast and Time Warner Cable for many of the same reasons.</p>

<p>PowWow&#8217;s platform allows enterprise-level clients to translate in-house Windows applications or web apps into iOS apps without lots of legwork. This is actually pretty useful for businesses that haven&#8217;t traditionally spent a lot of money keeping up with the latest tech, choosing instead to build their own desktop applications when necessary.</p>
<p>The startup said it plans to use the additional capital to hire more engineers and find more opportunities to grow the overall business. The funding round comes from OurCrowd, Vertical Venture Partners, IT-Farm, and others.</p>
<p>Founded in 2012, the San Francisco, Calif.-based startup has raised a total of $3.6 million in funding to date.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=venturebeat.com&#038;blog=342986&#038;post=1561157&#038;subd=venturebeat&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><br /><br /><p id="company-5424410500a0380454026924">						<p>

<p>So far, Loverly chief Kellee Khalil tells us, the company has seen a &#8220;456 percent increase in uniques&#8221; over the last 90 days. These new eyes were brought in by the <a href="http://lover.ly/planning/" target="_blank">content strategy</a> Loverly introduced three months ago.</p>
<p>Keeping to its core subject matter, wedding planning, Loverly&#8217;s blog produces Upworthy-esque stories like &#8220;<a href="http://lover.ly/planning/photo-video/after-this-brides-fiance-died-she-found-closure-through-an-incredible-photo-shoot/18835/" target="_blank">After This Bride&#8217;s Fiancé Died, She Found Closure through an Incredible Photo Shoot</a>,&#8221; along with more restrained how-to&#8217;s, like &#8220;<a href="http://lover.ly/planning/wedding-planning/how-to-elope/17942/" target="_blank">Everything You Need to Know About Eloping</a>.&#8221; Naturally, Loverly&#8217;s strategy has worked well; the content is apparently driving quite a bit of engagement.</p>
<p>The stories do particularly well on mobile, too, and quickly helped build the case for Loverly&#8217;s Android debut. Khalil tells us the company has seen a &#8220;287 percent increase in mobile traffic.&#8221; And Android owners now make up 35 percent of Loverly&#8217;s mobile visitors &#8212; up from 10 percent earlier this year.</p>
<p>As hinted at above, Loverly&#8217;s initial editorial success prompted the company to add content to its existing iOS app. You can preview both of the new apps in the gallery below.</p>

</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=venturebeat.com&#038;blog=342986&#038;post=1560989&#038;subd=venturebeat&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment-1561030"  class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:578px;"><div class="image-container single-feed"><img src="http://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/ingress-missions.jpg?w=578&#038;h=9999&#038;crop=0" style="max-width: 578px; max-height: 9999px;" alt="Google&#8217;s mobile game Ingress enables 7M players to create user-generated&nbsp;missions" class="single-feed" /></div><p class="wp-caption-text">Above: Ingress lets you design your own missions.</p><div class="vb_image_source"><em>Image Credit: Google Niantic</em></div></div><hr/><p>Google&#8217;s <a href="https://www.ingress.com/" target="_blank">Ingress</a> augmented reality mobile game has been downloaded by more than 7 million people in the past year. Now those players can create their own missions in the game that other people can enjoy.</p>
<p>The launch of these user-generated missions could lead to much more content for Ingress, which is a sci-fi game where two factions battle each other in a fanciful landscape that is layered on the real world. But these missions could also get people walking around cities looking for well-known or little-known landmarks, akin to a scavenger hunt. It&#8217;s another feature that could keep the number of players for Ingress growing even though the game is more than a year old.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s like a whole new game within Ingress,&#8221; said <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/02/09/google-niantics-ingress-aims-to-make-gamers-thinner-and-more-social-in-the-real-world-interview/">John Hanke</a>, the head of Google&#8217;s Niantic Labs division in San Francisco. &#8220;Users can generate missions and go on them anywhere in the world. We view this as a global discovery tool. It&#8217;s a little slice of Minecraft inside of Ingress.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today, the missions feature goes live on Android. It will debut on iOS at a future date.</p>
<p>The idea for the missions was always there. But the question was how to create enough of them for all of the Android and iOS players who are spread out among 200 countries around the world. So the only way to really get enough missions for local players was to enlist them in creating the missions.</p>
<p>Google may wind up with millions of missions. But the best ones will rise to the top through a voting process, and each user&#8217;s own mobile search will return missions that are nearby. If you want to make a tour of an area, you can check out the missions near you. The best ones will teach you something about your surroundings.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like a mission in a classic role-playing game,&#8221; Hanke said. &#8220;You go out on a quest to a series of places.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_1561031"  class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:558px;"><a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/09/25/googles-mobile-game-ingress-enables-7m-players-to-create-user-generated-missions/john-hanke-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-1561031"><img src="http://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/john-hanke.jpg?w=558&#038;h=361" alt="John Hanke of Google's Niantic division" class="wp-image-1561031 size-large" height="361" width="558" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Above: John Hanke of Google&#8217;s Niantic division</p><div class="vb_image_source"><em>Image Credit: Dean Takahashi</em></div></div>
<p>You can go to premarked &#8220;portals&#8221; that other players have set up. More than 10 million portals have been submitted, and a few million have been approved.</p>
<p>Or you can visit &#8220;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nianticproject.scout&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Field Trip cards</a>,&#8221; which are geo-located and include places like restaurants and bars that players have marked and described. Google has more than 200 Field Trip publisher partners who have created locations that teach mobile users about history, art, architecture, outdoor activities, shopping, and dining.</p>
<p>Niantic is creating its own missions as well. You can go to Gold Rush era sites in downtown San Francisco or micro breweries in Berkeley, Calif. The missions can also be mysterious. They may present you with a challenge at each site. You have to solve that challenge to get a clue for the next site, Hanke said. While you&#8217;re doing a mission, you can also get a lot of exercise. Hanke made a mission around Lake Merritt in Oakland, Calif. that takes you on a 2.5-mile walk.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty open-ended,&#8221; Hanke said. &#8220;We are giving the quest-making tools to users and letting them run with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other missions may require Agents to visit a series of places and perform an action like hacking or capturing a portal. You can easily create the missions on your mobile phone by selecting portals to use as waypoints in the mission.</p>
<p>Ingress has developed a strong community of users by hosting live, in-person events, known as Anomaly events. At these locations, the two warring factions gather in one place, such as a statue in a plaza, and fight for control of the landmark. More than 30,000 people have participated in Ingress events. That enables Ingress Agents to meet each other in person, make new friends, discover new places, and undertake interesting adventures.</p>
<p>The Niantic staff has scripted a lot of the story for the game and the events. But now it&#8217;s the player&#8217;s turn. At first, Niantic approved a white list of approved users to create missions, and it is opening that up to the larger group now. Currently, the Agents have to be at level five or above to create a mission. The Niantic staff will curate missions to ensure that no one does anything nefarious, like putting a pornographic picture in the mission description. The good missions will rise to the top via proximity and rating.</p>
<p>In a related matter, Google is launching an e-book version of the Ingress story on Oct. 6.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment-968013"  class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:578px;"><div class="image-container single-feed"><img src="http://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/facebook-whatsapp.jpg?w=578&#038;h=9999&#038;crop=0" style="max-width: 578px; max-height: 9999px;" alt="Watch out, Google: Facebook readies new mobile ad&nbsp;platform" class="single-feed" /></div><div class="vb_image_source"><em>Image Credit: Illustration: Eric Blattberg / VentureBeat</em></div></div><hr/><p>Facebook is apparently moving away from the cookie &#8212; and it may announce its plans for a new mobile ad network this Monday at <a href="http://www.advertisingweek.com/" target="_blank">Advertising Week</a>.</p>
<p>There is mass speculation across the virtual ad world that the Menlo Park-based social kingpin will very soon unveil a new, more advanced mobile marketing paradigm in a bid to knock Google, the number-one player in the mobile ad space in terms of pure revenue, off the block. The platform will rely on Facebook&#8217;s trove of raw human data with less dependence on cookies for deploying and tracking mobile campaigns. And word on the street is Facebook, number two in mobile ad revenue behind Google, may unveil its new platform this Monday at the ad industry&#8217;s annual event, which opens next week in the Big Apple.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our gut says that this will be mobile-centric and built on Facebook data using Facebook identification instead of cookies. Where I am super excited [is] the focus on measurement and cross-channel attributions, like being able to track users between desktop and mobile &#8212; it’s impossible otherwise,&#8221; said <a href="http://www.metamorphic.vc/" target="_blank">David Hirsch</a>, a Google ad veteran who spent eight years at the company.</p>
<p>Hirsch joined Google in 2000 and was a founding member of the company&#8217;s advertising team. In fact, he was involved in the creation of the first iteration of <a href="http://www.google.com/adwords/start/?sourceid=awo&amp;subid=us-en-ha-aw-brhte3~53094049085&amp;gclid=CN2drOn0-sACFUZgfgodCCkA1Q" target="_blank">Google AdWords</a>. Today, AdWords has emerged as one of the Google&#8217;s top revenue generators and has helped push Google itself to the as yet undisputed king of the mobile ad spend. These days, Hirsch runs Metamorphic Ventures in New York.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Mobile developer or publisher?<br />
<a href="http://insight.venturebeat.com/report/mobile-user-acquisition-how-most-successful-developers-get-better-users-less-money?utm_source=vbnews&amp;utm_medium=in-article-callout&amp;utm_content=middle-of-article&amp;utm_term=with-ios-8-due-out-soon-hipchat-revamps-its-app-for-more-efficiency&amp;utm_campaign=mobile-user-acquisition">Learn how the most successful developers get better users for less money.</a></p>
<hr />
<p>There is a lot at stake in the mobile ecosystem &#8212; and Facebook recognizes this.</p>
<p>About 500 players currently occupy a space that amounted to over $17 billion last year, a number expected to crest $35 billion by the end of 2014, according to eMarketer. Ad brokers, ad exchanges, retargeters, publishers, and analytic outfits currently operate within it, all vying for a piece of a pie that eMarketer projects will grow nearly 100 percent year-over-year for the foreseeable future. That&#8217;s because more Americans are getting comfortable relegating more responsibility to mobile devices like smartphones and tablets.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are busy building something behind those doors, and there&#8217;s clearly a gag order for the people I met with on the advertising side not to talk about it,&#8221; said a mobile executive who works closely with Facebook who requested anonymity.</p>
<p>In order to buttress its mobile offerings, Facebook has acquired 15 companies since 2013, including mobile analytics, back-end, and app companies such as <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/02/19/two-geeks-16-billion-and-a-killer-facebook-purchase/">WhatsApp</a> for $19 billion. But numerous people interviewed for this story strongly believe that whatever the new platform turns out to be, it will have some genesis in Facebook&#8217;s purchase of Microsoft&#8217;s ad server Atlas Solutions, in <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/02/28/atlas-shrugged-facebook-acquires-atlas-ad-platform-from-microsoft/">February 2013</a>, for a sum estimated to be in the region of $100 million.</p>
<p>The reasoning follows that Facebook engineers have been heavily souping up the formerly Windows-centric ad platform, building cross-channel features into it. And whatever Facebook unveils, sources told VentureBeat, it&#8217;s likely to include at least some of the remnants of the original Atlas platform.</p>
<p>“If marketers and agencies can get a holistic view of campaign performance, they will be able to do a much better job of making sure the right messages get in front of the right people at the right time,” Brian Boland, Facebook’s director of product marketing, said on a <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2013/02/facebook-to-acquire-atlas-from-microsoft/" target="_blank">blog post at the time of the Atlas acquisition</a>. “Atlas has built capabilities that allow for this kind of measurement, and enhancing these systems will give marketers a deeper understanding of effectiveness and lead to better digital advertising experiences for consumers.”</p>
<p>Indeed, Valerie Davis, <a href="http://www.pmdigital.com/" target="_blank">PM Digital&#8217;s </a>veep for search media, told VentureBeat in an email that Facebook may actually be relaunching Atlas itself, albeit with tweaks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, this is all theoretical as we haven’t seen it live yet, but in my opinion, the relaunch of Atlas will give Google’s DFA [DoubleClick For Advertisers, an ad management service] a run for their money,&#8221; Davis said. &#8220;Facebook has seemingly managed to solve this device-agnostic ad-targeting obstacle ahead of Google, which will definitely set them apart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;However, Google will remain the clear winner in the space until Atlas has a proven record of success,&#8221; Davis added.</p>
<p>Facebook has been steadily chipping into Google&#8217;s mobile marketing ad dominance since last year. In 2012, Google had 52 percent of the mobile ad market, and the following year, that number decreased to 49 percent. It now stands at about 46 percent. Twitter is also catching up.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the Facebook workers toiling like Santa&#8217;s elves behind closed doors, building, tweaking, and polishing their new mobile-centric platform, will likely to be another game changer, ad veterans told VentureBeat. Despite its weight, Facebook assuredly is still agile enough to surprise even the most jaded technologists.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are moving from a world of inferred data and social signals to real human data. Facebook has evolved from a &#8216;social&#8217; network to a social and communication operating system that seems to be ubiquitous with how people spend their time online,&#8221; Hirsch said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have gone from a world of thinking about mobile-to-mobile strategy, to mobile-first, to mobile-agnostic with &#8230; iOS and Android, eventually to mobile only.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=venturebeat.com&#038;blog=342986&#038;post=1560750&#038;subd=venturebeat&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><div class="post-boilerplate boilerplate-after"><hr />
