				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of Steve Ballmer&rsquo;s first acts as owner of the Los Angeles Clippers might be to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/25/us-nba-clippers-ballmer-idUSKCN0HK05P20140925" target="_blank">do away</a> with the team&#8217;s iPads.</p>
<p>In an interview with Reuters on his plans for the NBA franchise he bought for $2 billion a few months ago, the former Microsoft CEO revealed that the fate of all the Apple devices used by the team&rsquo;s staff was one of the first things head coach Doc Rivers brought up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s one of the first things he said to me: &#8216;We are probably going to get rid of these iPads, aren&rsquo;t we?&#8217; And I said, &#8216;Yeah, we probably are.&#8217; But I promised we would do it during the off-season,&#8221; Ballmer said.</p>
<p>Not surprising, considering that Ballmer was the CEO of Apple&rsquo;s major competitor for 14 years and is still the company&rsquo;s largest individual shareholder. In fact, his loyalty to his old company is so strong that no one in his family is allowed to use an iPhone. So why should his team be any different?</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of the Clippers are on Windows, some of the players and coaches are not,&#8221; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>If the ban goes ahead, any iPads the team uses for courtside strategy will most likely be replaced by Microsoft&rsquo;s Surface tablets.</p>
<p>The Clippers, under Ballmer&rsquo;s ownership, will hope to emerge from the shadow of their former owner <a href="http://deadspin.com/donald-sterling-still-a-vicious-racist-according-to-tm-1567966769" target="_blank">Donald Sterling</a>, who was banned from the NBA and forced to sell his team earlier this year after racist comments he made to his then girlfriend became public.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What has happened to Kim Jong Un?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the question everyone seems to be asking, amid all kinds of rumors following the North Korean dictator&rsquo;s uncharacteristic three-week absence from the public eye. Kim was last seen alongside his wife Ri Sol Ju at a concert in Pyongyang on Sept. 3, and several news outlets are speculating that the 31-year-old may be ill.</p>
<p>The rumors intensified on Thursday with the North Korean leader&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/25/us-northkorea-parliament-idUSKCN0HK1L520140925" target="_blank">absence</a> from an important parliament meeting. Reuters reported that state-television broadcast images of his empty chair at the Supreme People&rsquo;s Assembly, the country&rsquo;s highest sovereign body, the first such powwow he has missed since coming to power three years ago.</p>
<p>The <em>Wall Street</em> <em>Journal</em> <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2014/09/26/does-kim-jong-un-have-gout/" target="_blank">speculated</a> on Friday that Kim might be suffering from gout, a disease caused primarily by an excessive intake of meat, sugar and alcohol. A South Korean official told the <em>Journal</em> that gout runs in the tyrannical clan, starting with Kim&rsquo;s grandfather Kim Il Sung, who died in 1994 at age 82. Kim also suffers from obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes, he added.</p>
<p>Such rumors have been fueled by reports that North Korean television showed the country&rsquo;s Supreme Leader walking with a pronounced limp back in July.</p>
<p>Another theory about his condition, <a href="https://au.news.yahoo.com/world/a/25119447/south-korean-officials-steer-clear-of-kim-health-rumours/" target="_blank">according</a> to Agence France-Presse<em>, </em>is that he picked up an injury while providing &ldquo;guidance&rdquo; to North Korean athletes competing in the Asian Games, currently in progress at Incheon, South Korea.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=time.com&#038;blog=1359921&#038;post=3432195&#038;subd=timedotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Casualty figures from explosions and their aftermath in China&#8217;s restive Xinjiang region last weekend have been increased from two dead to about 50 dead, with some 50 injured, according to state media&#8217;s reporting of official figures on Friday.</p>
<p>The unverified numbers are a significant and belated <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-29373158" target="_blank">revision</a> to the authorities&rsquo; claim five days ago that two people had died in the unrest, the BBC reports.</p>
<p>State media now report that six people died on Sunday in what are described as terrorist bombings at two police stations, a market and a shop in southwestern Xinjiang, the BBC says.</p>
<p>The same official news portals say that security forces later shot and killed people described as &ldquo;rioters.&rdquo; In total, 50 people died, comprising 40 &ldquo;rioters,&rdquo; six civilians and four police officers, the reports said.</p>
<p>Radio Free Asia, which has Uighur reporters, gave <a href="http://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/violence-09252014005018.html" target="_blank">different statistics</a>, saying that about a dozen people were killed and 100 more injured in bomb blasts at three locations. Its report said the injured included 20 police officers.</p>
<p>Xinjiang &ndash; home to Turkic-speaking Muslim Uighurs &mdash; has become a hotbed of violence over the past year, with some 200 people dead in clashes there.</p>
<p>Beijing has blamed foreign-trained terrorist groups for the attacks, but human-rights observers put the responsibility for the escalating bloodshed on the central government, saying its discriminatory policies against Uighurs are fanning resentment in the region.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a Chinese court sentenced a leading academic voice for Uighur rights, Ilham Tohti, to life in prison &mdash; a harsh sentence that appeared to signal China&#8217;s determination to crush even moderate dissent in its western region.</p>
<p>Some observers, however, say the widely condemned sentence will do just the opposite, silencing an influential and peaceful voice for reform and, in stoking outrage in Xinjiang, herald even more violence.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=time.com&#038;blog=1359921&#038;post=3432189&#038;subd=timedotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[That's because it's housed inside a lion statue on the roof of the Old State House<img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=time.com&#038;blog=1359921&#038;post=3431755&#038;subd=timedotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Boston officials are puzzling over how to retrieve a 113-year-old time capsule from inside a lion statue on Boston&#8217;s Old State House.</p>
<p>The time capsule, mentioned in a 1901 Boston<em> Daily Globe</em> article, is a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/25/us-usa-massachusetts-time-capsule-idUSKCN0HK2HM20140925" target="_blank">copper box</a> containing contributions from local elected officials of the time, plus buttons from the presidential campaigns of William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt, Reuters reports.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The work of the coppersmith is completed, and one of the last things he did was to seal a copper box, which is placed in the head of the lion, and which contains contributions from state and city officials, the Boston daily newspapers, the name of the maker of the lion and unicorn, and others, which will prove interesting when the box is opened many years hence,&rdquo; reads the Feb. 1901 article.</p>
<p>But the catch is the statue: an iconic, golden lion that has, for 113 years, graced the roof of the 301-year-old Old State House, a red-brick building in Boston&rsquo;s downtown.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are determining the best way to retrieve the time capsule without damaging the lion,&#8221; Heather Leet, director of development for the Bostonian Society, which maintains the building, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Boston&#8217;s Old State House, where the Declaration of Independence was read to cheering crowds from the building&rsquo;s east balcony in 1776, was the first seat of the Massachusetts government, and is these days a popular stop for tourists walking the Freedom Trail.</p>
<p>The lion statue and its rooftop neighbor, a silver unicorn &mdash; both are symbols of the British monarchy &mdash; were taken off the building for <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2014/09/23/year-old-time-capsule-found-inside-old-state-house-statue/PQvmhKuXEkbIHx0SF7i6pO/story.html" target="_blank">maintenance</a> earlier this month, Boston.com says.</p>
<p>Leet told Reuters that the group has known about the hidden box for several years, because a descendant of one of the statue&rsquo;s sculptors sent them a letter about it. A fiber-optic camera, threaded into a hole in the statue, confirms the box&rsquo;s existence.</p>
<p>Under the hashtag #LionAndUnicorn, the Bostonian Society has been crowd-sourcing ideas from locals on Twitter, asking them for suggestions on what to add to the capsule. Current ideas include &#8220;fossilized cannoli,&#8221; Dunkin Donuts styrofoam cups, and &#8220;Boston Strong&#8221; gear inspired by the city&#8217;s pulling together after the bombing of the Boston Marathon in 2013.</p>
<p>There was also the suggestion of a One Direction album. Sound the alarm; the British are coming. Again.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The move by an outgoing parliament is seen as a blow to democracy and a bid to undermine President-elect Joko Widodo<img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=time.com&#038;blog=1359921&#038;post=3431596&#038;subd=timedotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Indonesian parliament voted to scrap direct elections for regional office-bearers early Friday &mdash; a decision that critics say is a step backward for democracy in the world&rsquo;s fourth most populous nation and biggest Muslim-majority country.</p>
<p>When Indonesians woke up to the news, many reacted with anger and fury. &ldquo;A Democratic Betrayal,&rdquo; read the Jakarta <em>Globe</em> headline on Friday.</p>
<p>It was former presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto&#8217;s Gerindra Party, and his Red-White Coalition partners, that pushed to have district chiefs, mayors and governors indirectly voted in by local parliaments, as they were in 2005. Under the new legislation, governors from Prabowo&rsquo;s coalition, which controls 31 out of 34 provincial legislatures, are expected to dominate the country.</p>
<p>The bill was passed just days before the current lawmakers end their term on Sept. 30, and weeks before Jakarta Governor Joko &ldquo;Jokowi&rdquo; Widodo is inaugurated as President on Oct. 20.</p>
<p>Supporters of the move say direct elections are expensive and rife with fraud &mdash; a point dismissed by opponents, including Corruption Eradication Commission officials, who say indirect elections invite even more corruption.</p>
<p>The initiative is seen not only as an attempt by Prabowo &mdash; who <a href="http://time.com/2970051/indonesia-election-limbo/">lost the July election to Jokowi</a> but has yet to congratulate him &mdash; to undermine his rival even before he resumes office, but also as a bid by the widely distrusted <a href="http://time.com/105650/indonesias-obama-is-actually-nothing-of-the-sort/">political elite</a>, of which Prabowo is a leading figure, to wrest power from ordinary people.</p>
<p>&#8220;Society will need to be prepared for leaders who are going to obey local parliaments more than they serve the people,&#8221; says Titi Anggraini, executive director of Perludem, an NGO focusing on elections-related advocacy.</p>
<p>Much of the anger is directed at outgoing President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, widely known by his initials SBY. He and his Democratic Party, which controls nearly a third of the parliamentary seats, said they would support direct elections. But, in the end, many Democrat lawmakers absented themselves from the voting when their demands for revisions were not meant, dealing a blow to Jokowi&rsquo;s coalition and allowing the bill to pass.</p>
<p>The hashtag #ShameOnYouSBY was the top trending topic in Indonesia on Friday. &ldquo;Congratulations Pak @SBYudhoyono &ndash; now you have a legacy as the President who let democracy move backwards,&rdquo; said one Twitter user.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two generals have killed our democracy: Prabowo and SBY,&rdquo; tweeted Luthfi Assyaukanie, of the Freedom Institute think tank, referring to the fact that both men are former military officers.</p>
<p>Yudhoyono later told journalists in Washington, D.C., where he is on a state visit, that he was &ldquo;disappointed with the process and the result.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Direct elections have been credited with the emergence of popular and untainted regional leaders who are not party oligarchs. It has given rise to humble politicians like Jokowi, who began his career as the mayor of the Javanese city of Solo; his deputy governor, Basuki T.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Police in East Lansing, Mich., reportedly arrested Charlotte Hornets small forward Jeff Taylor for a second time on Thursday afternoon and charged the player with malicious destruction of a building.</p>
<p>The damage inflicted on the building was valued at less than $200, and he was later bonded out, <a href="http://www.wilx.com/home/headlines/NBAs-Jeff-Taylor-Charged-with-Domestic-Assault-in-East-Lansing-277160651.html">according</a> to a local NBC affiliate.</p>
<p>The arrest comes only hours after Taylor was charged with domestic assault, assault and malicious destruction of property.</p>
<p>In the early hours of Thursday morning, the Swedish-American small forward was allegedly involved in an altercation at the East Lansing Marriott; however, authorities have yet to release a detailed account of what happened, according to <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/11589636/jeff-taylor-charlotte-hornets-arrested-domestic-assault">ESPN</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Charlotte Hornets were made aware of the incident involving Jeffery Taylor early this evening. The organization is in the process of gathering more information and doing our due diligence,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.nba.com/2014/news/09/25/hornets-statement-jeffery-taylor/index.html?rss=true">read</a> a statement released by the Hornets. &ldquo;This is a matter that we take very seriously.&#8221;</p>
<p>An NBA spokesperson reportedly told the sports broadcaster that the league had commenced an investigation into the matter as well.</p>
<p>The allegations of Taylor&rsquo;s misconduct come days after the NBA promised to review its policies regarding domestic violence in the wake of the NFL&rsquo;s recent experiences with Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson.</p>
<p>&#8220;We learn from other league&#8217;s experiences. We&#8217;re studying everything that&#8217;s been happening in the NFL,&#8221; NBA commissioner Adam Silver <a href="http://www.nba.com/2014/news/09/22/adam-silver-nba-domestic-violence.ap/index.html">told</a> a press conference in New York City earlier this week.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=time.com&#038;blog=1359921&#038;post=3431615&#038;subd=timedotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two dogs that flunked out of New York City&rsquo;s Guiding Eyes for the Blind program have found a <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-09-23/a-police-dog-for-the-digital-age-she-can-smell-the-usb-drive-you-re-hiding.html" target="_blank">new job</a> helping police find hidden electronic devices, Bloomberg reports.</p>
<p>The skill is proving useful to investigators looking for devices containing, for instance, child pornography or fraudulent documents.</p>
<p>Black Labrador Selma and golden Labrador Thoreau underwent months of training to be able to sniff out laptops, digital cameras, flash drives and even memory cards. The dogs were trained to detect the scent of a particular chemical common to all these devices on people&rsquo;s hands, clothes, metal boxes and even concrete blocks.</p>
<p>The chemical, which police have declined to name, was identified by forensic-science veteran Jack Hubball, who in 1986 isolated a flame accelerant present in cases of arson that could be detected by dogs. He later helped train canines to sniff out narcotics and bombs.</p>
<p>In his latest work, Hubball took apart circuit boards, hard disks and flash drives and tested each component individually to pinpoint the chemical they shared.</p>
<p>Detective George Jupin of the Connecticut State Police Computer Crimes Unit, who is Selma&rsquo;s handler, told Bloomberg that the animal had assisted in over 50 search warrants since starting in October 2013. Selma has found child pornography, falsified documents and stored software that was used to help identify firearms in a homicide case.</p>
<p>Thoreau is doing similar work with the Rhode Island State Police.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(COLUMBIA, S.C.) &mdash; A South Carolina state trooper&#8217;s dashboard video shows an unarmed driver being shot just seconds after he was stopped for a seatbelt offense &mdash; and the trooper, who was fired last week, has now been charged with assault.</p>
<p>As Levar Jones cried in pain waiting for an ambulance, he repeated one question: &#8220;Why did you shoot me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jones&#8217; painful groans and then-Trooper Sean Groubert&#8217;s reply &mdash; &#8220;Well you dove head first back into your car&#8221; &mdash; were captured by the camera.</p>
<p>Groubert&#8217;s boss, state Public Safety Director Leroy Smith, called the video &#8220;disturbing&#8221; and said &#8220;Groubert reacted to a perceived threat where there was none&#8221; as he fired the officer Friday.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old former trooper is charged with assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature, a felony that carries up to 20 years in prison. He was released after paying 10 percent of a $75,000 bond.</p>
<p>The dashboard camera video was released by prosecutors Wednesday night after they showed it at Groubert&#8217;s bond hearing.</p>
<p>Jones was stopped Sept. 4 as he pulled into a convenience store on a busy Columbia road. With the camera recording, Groubert pulls up without his siren on as Jones is getting out of his vehicle to go into the store.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I see your license please?&#8221; Groubert asks.</p>
<p>As Jones turns and reaches back into his car, Groubert shouts, &#8220;Get outa the car, get outa the car.&#8221; He begins firing before he has finished the second sentence. There is a third shot as Jones staggers away, backing up with his hands raised, and then a fourth.</p>
<p>From the first shot to the fourth, the video clicks off three seconds.</p>
<p>Jones&#8217; wallet can be seen flying out of his hands as he raises them.</p>
<p>Groubert&#8217;s lawyer, Barney Giese, said the shooting was justified because the trooper feared for his life and the safety of others. Police officers are rarely charged in South Carolina. In August, a prosecutor refused to file criminal charges against a York County deputy who shot a 70-year-old man after mistaking his cane for a shotgun during an after-dark traffic stop.</p>
<p>Groubert is white and Jones is black. Neither state police nor the FBI keep detailed statistics on the races of people in officer-involved shootings.</p>
<p>Much like the recent police shooting of a black teenager in Ferguson, Missouri, the racial aspect of the South Carolina shooting bothers state Rep. Joe Neal, an African-American lawmaker who has spoken out against racism in law enforcement for years.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are doing exactly what the police officer asked you do to and you get shot for it?&#8221; said Neal, D-Hopkins. &#8220;That&#8217;s insane.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neal said he doubts the trooper would have been charged without the video. South Carolina has nearly 300 police agencies, and many smaller forces don&#8217;t have dashboard cameras.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it had been the trooper&#8217;s story versus his story, I&#8217;m not sure anything happens,&#8221; Neal said.</p>
<p>Jones is recovering after being shot in the hip. He released a statement last week saying he hopes his shooting leads to changes in how police officers treat suspects.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thank God every day that I am here with a story to tell and hope my situation can make a change,&#8221; Jones said.</p>
<p>He and his lawyer have not spoken publicly since Groubert was charged Wednesday.</p>
<p>Groubert first worked for the Highway Patrol from September 2005 to September 2009. After going to work for the Richland County Sheriff&#8217;s Office, he returned to the state agency in July 2012.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time Groubert fired his service weapon. In August 2012, Groubert and another trooper chased a man who drove away from a traffic stop and fired at the suspect after he shot first, according to the Highway Patrol. The suspect was convicted of attempted murder and is spending 20 years in prison.</p>
<p>Groubert was awarded the agency&#8217;s Medal of Valor Award for his actions in protecting the public.</p>
<p>So far in 2014 in South Carolina, police have shot at suspects 35 times, killing 16 of them, according to the State Law Enforcement Division. The number of officer-involved shootings has been steadily increasing over the past few years, with 42 reported in 2013.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=time.com&#038;blog=1359921&#038;post=3431744&#038;subd=timedotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You cannot write scripts like this. In the top of the ninth inning with the Yankees leading the Orioles 5-2, Derek Jeter took the field at Yankee Stadium for what was supposed to be the last time in his illustrious Hall-of-Fame career. But the Baseball Gods had other plans.</p>
<p>After a Nick Markakis walk and Alejandro De Aza strikeout, Adam Jones homered to left field off Yankees closer David Robertson to cut the Orioles&rsquo; deficit to one. Robertson then struck out Nelson Cruz to put New York one out away from the victory. But as fate would have it, Steve Pearce took the first pitch he saw, a 91-MPH cutter, and blasted the game-tying home run.</p>
<p>Due up third in the bottom of the ninth, Jeter would bat again.</p>
<p>Orioles manager Buck Showalter replaced pitcher Joe Saunders with Evan Meek, who allowed a single to Jose Pirela to begin the bottom of the ninth. After Antoan Richardson replaced Pirela as a pinch runner, Brett Gardner put down a sacrifice bunt to advance Richardson to second base.</p>
<p>Jeter, who had already <a href="http://www.si.com/mlb/2014/09/25/watch-derek-jeter-rbi-double-yankee-stadium-final-game" target="_blank">doubled in his first at-bat</a> before driving in the go-ahead RBI in the seventh inning, stepped into the batter&rsquo;s box with one out, a runner in scoring position and a chance to further etch his name into the Yankees&rsquo; annals. And he delivered.</p>
<p>Jeter &mdash; with his trademark inside-out swing &mdash; went after the first pitch, an 86-MPH changeup and slashed it between first and second base. Richardson beat the throw home, the Yankees&#8217; dugout flew onto the field and Jeter, normally humble and mild-mannered, let out a huge smile as he threw his hands into the air. The Yankee Stadium crowd burst into a frenzy and YES Network play-by-play announcer Michael Kay fell silent as Jeter, his teammates, the city of New York and the game of baseball reveled in the moment.</p>
<p>The image of Jeter walking off in his final home at-bat will be a lasting memory, one of far too many to count in his 20-year career. But more importantly, perhaps it&rsquo;s a microcosm of Jeter doing what he&rsquo;s always done. Win.</p>
