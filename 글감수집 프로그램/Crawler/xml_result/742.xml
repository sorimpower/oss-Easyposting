<p>JUST WEEKS ago, my daughter’s mother moved out of state. The kid’s been having a tough time with it, and with school, and with her upcoming tenth birthday, which won’t work out the way she hoped. And then, over the weekend, her laptop and mine both broke—hers by cat-and-ginger-ale misfortune, mine by gravity abetted by my stupidity.</p>
<p>To lighten the mood, this morning broke grey, pounding rain. We pulled on our hoodies, scooped up our bodega umbrellas, and shrugged on our backpacks—hers heavy with school books, mine with gym clothes, a camera, and two busted laptops.</p>
<p>We were standing by the elevator when an apartment door burst open and Ava&#8217;s best friend in the world sprinted down the hall to hug her good morning. The two girls embraced until the elevator arrived.</p>
<p>The whole dark wet walk to school, my child hummed happily to herself.</p>
<p>#1hug</p>

<p class="intro">ACCESSIBILITY IS LIKE the weather: everyone talks about it, but not enough of us do anything about it. Austin-based <a href="http://www.knowbility.org">Knowbility</a> is one of the few groups in the world with the commitment and expertise to change this. If enough of us fund their <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/online-training-to-make-sites-and-apps-accessible">new IndieGogo project</a>, they’ll gain the resources they need to create online modules that teach the world how to make our sites work for people with disabilities. This is a cause any web designer or developer should be able to get behind.</p>
<p>I love the web because it is democratic, agnostic, and empowering. Progressive enhancement, responsive design, and other core components of standards-based web design are all about making sure that the experiences we create online are available to any person, via any browser, on any device. That promise is the heart of web accessibility. It will seem obvious to most folks reading this page that a site that works for all is way better than a site that works only for some.</p>
<p>Yet, for all the sophistication and excitement of modern web design, accessibility remains the least-taught, least-understood, least-cared-about of all our new and classic best practices. Let’s help Knowbility change that. Let’s help them help us, and, by extension, help everyone who uses the web (or tries to).</p>
<p>Please contribute to, and spread the word about, Online Training to Make Sites and Apps Accessible: <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/online-training-to-make-sites-and-apps-accessible">igg.me/at/knowbility</a>. And please hurry! There are only five days left to make a difference.</p>

<p class="intro">PIONEERING design &#8216;zine <a href='http://netdiver.net/'>Netdiver</a> is back, baby!</p>
<p>Founded by my friend and colleague Carole Guevin in 1998, Netdiver was one of the first web &#8216;zines to seriously explore and promote design and design culture on the web. In its pages, you would discover pretty much everything exciting that was happening in web and digital design, photography, industrial design, and digital filmmaking. </p>
<p>Sites as fine (and as different) as <a href="http://www.swiss-miss.com">Swissmiss</a> and <a href="https://thegreatdiscontent.com">The Great Discontent</a> can trace more than a strand of their DNA back to Netdiver and its creator.</p>
<p>Like many of the great zines and blogs from the first and second waves of indy web publishing, Netdiver has been quiet over the past few years. It&#8217;s a thrill to see it come roaring back to life. Maybe it&#8217;s a sign. Maybe a long overdue re-flowering of blogs and independent websites is imminent. A boy can dream.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="intro">WHEN my daughter was little, she used to ask me my favorite color. I was a grownup, and could only supply a grownup’s answer: “I love the way light looks in late afternoon,” I might say. Or, “Red and black can make powerful statements in graphic design.” Grownups don’t have favorite colors. But children do.</p>
<p>Rebecca Meyer had a favorite color. It was purple. A color that might be expressed in the hexadecimal language of web design as #663399.</p>
<p>As many of you know, Eric and Kat Meyer <a href="https://twitter.com/meyerweb/status/475423495178838016">lost their daughter Rebecca</a> to cancer on Saturday.  Rebecca Alison Meyer was a ray of light. She was six years, eleven and a half hours old when she died. </p>
<p>Some of us know Eric through his two decades of work on behalf of web development and web standards.  Some of us know Eric and Kat as friends. Some of us only know of the Meyerses because of Rebecca&#8217;s story, as her parents courageously and with unyielding clarity shared it over the internet day after day during the past year.</p>
<p>All the caring and all the medicine, all the prayers and all the love from friends and strangers, could not stop this cancer from claiming this child. Caught between horror and hope, all of us watched as the Meyer family fought to save their beautiful middle child’s life. They did everything that could be done to save Rebecca. Then they did more.</p>
<p>Now it’s time to do something for them. Some little, heartbreakingly inadequate thing for a girl who got dragged into a fight no one could win, and stayed a pure, brave spirit to the end.</p>
<p>Rebecca will be buried this Thursday, 12 June. On that day, let us celebrate Rebecca by calling the internet&#8217;s attention to her. In the <a href="https://twitter.com/mattrobin140s/status/476109575532601344">words of Matt Robin</a>, who came up with the idea, “let’s get #663399Becca trending for Thursday 12th.”</p>
<p>It’s so easy to do, there&#8217;s no reason not to. Go to Twitter on 12 June and post the hashtag #663399Becca along with any additional words or pictures you feel moved to share. Or just share the hashtag. It will not be enough. Nothing will ever be enough. But it will be something.</p>
<p>(<a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2014/06/09/in-memoriam-2/">The family requests</a> that charitable donations be made in Rebecca’s name to the Philadelphia Ronald McDonald House or the St. Baldrick’s Foundation.)</p>

<p class="intro">MY DAUGHTER cries and begs me not to leave on my business trip. I hold her and tell her I will return soon.</p>
<p>My grandfather died in a plane crash between New York and California. My mother, who was eleven, had begged him not to leave. He lied and told her he would cancel the trip. I never lie to my daughter. </p>
<p>I always thought my grandfather died on a business trip. Two years ago I finally learned he was actually flying to California to divorce my grandmother. My mother never told me. </p>
<p>My grandmother never told her children their father was dead. They figured it out gradually.</p>
<p>When my mother was a young adult, her fiancée died in a plane crash. </p>
<p>My mother was never able to be happy, to feel safe, to trust the world. </p>
<p>One of my jobs is to help my daughter learn to be happy, to feel safe, to trust the world. </p>
<p>It is hard for any parent. Harder when you are divorced. My daughter is sensitive, creative, and has a learning disability. She feels different from other kids. Family is everything to her. </p>
<p>My daughter is everything to me. To support her, I do several jobs. Jobs I love, working with people I love and trust. One of my jobs requires me to travel frequently, staying away for up to a week at a time. </p>
<p>My father worked twelve hours a day to support his family. We grew up in his absence and long shadow. </p>
<p>I am grateful for my daughter&#8217;s life and my ability to spend so much time with her. She knows her parents love her and will always be there for her.</p>
<p>But when I leave, she cries, and I cry inside.</p>

<p>by SUSAN ROBERTSON</p>
<p>A style guide, also referred to as a pattern library, is a living document that details the front-end code for all the elements and modules of a website or application. It also documents the site’s visual language, from header styles to color palettes. In short, a proper style guide is a one-stop guide that the entire team can reference when considering site changes and iterations. Susan Robertson shows us how to build and maintain a style guide that helps everyone from product owners and producers to designers and developers keep an ever-changing site on brand and on target.</p>
<h3><a href="http://alistapart.com/article/the-z-axis-designing-for-the-future">The Z-Axis: Designing for the Future</a></h3>
<p>by WREN LANIER</p>
<p>For years we’ve seen the web as a two-dimensional space filled with pages that sit side by side on a flat, infinite plane. But as the devices we design for take on an increasingly diverse array of shapes and sizes, we must embrace new ways of designing up and down. Designing on the z-axis means incorporating three-dimensional physics into our interface designs. Wren Lanier explains how, by using the z-axis to place interface elements above or below one another, we can create better design systems that are more flexible and intuitive to use—and create new patterns that point the way to future interactions.</p>

<p class="intro"><a href="http://www.muleradio.net/thebigwebshow/116/">IN BIG WEB SHOW № 116</a> (“Everything Web That Matters”), I chat with Phillip Reyland and Roland Dubois, cofounders of Byte Dept., a NYC agency that designs and builds digital products for brands and agencies, and that created the popular Bike Department app for iOS.</p>
<p>We discuss&#8230;</p>
<p>Creating products for clients instead of yourself. Four strategies to apply to every product: experience strategy, platform strategy, mobile strategy, and integration strategy. Rethinking the mobile bike app: using data to predict whether a bike will be there when you get to it. The experience layer versus the visual layer. Finding the right partner. Working with ad agencies. The difference between ideas and products, and how to explain it to your client. The wild world of wearables. And more.</p>

<p class="intro">SO MY DAD had another seizure—it’s been about six months since the last one; nobody knows what causes them or how to prevent them. <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2014/03/24/a-temporary-reprieve/">It was 4:00 AM Monday morning</a>. He fell heavily, like a sack of bricks, and cracked open his skull above his right eye. There was blood everywhere on the tiled floor of his bathroom, his wife Catherine says.</p>
<p>Catherine called 911. She couldn’t do it from the phone in the bedroom; she went running through the house looking for a working portable phone. The ambulance came fast and he was rushed to Presbyterian Hospital in Pittsburgh, where he stayed overnight.</p>
<p>The hospital wanted to keep him an extra day for fear that the blood floating around inside his skull could clot and kill him or damage his brain. But he demanded to be released. Got so caught up arguing with his nurse that he forgot he and I were on the telephone. </p>
<p>He may have feared that he would never leave that hospital if he didn’t exit immediately. I get that.</p>
<p>The hospital relented, and he and Catherine drove home, where he called me via FaceTime. His face is horribly bruised and cracked—he resembles the De Niro version of Frankenstein’s monster. But he seems to be all right. His mind and character are what they always were. </p>

<p class="intro">IN <a href="http://www.muleradio.net/thebigwebshow/115/">BIG WEB SHOW № 115</a> on Mule Radio, I talk with Anil Dash, a hugely influential entrepreneur, blogger, and web geek living in NYC.</p>
<p>Things we discuss include:</p>
<p>How government, media, and tech shape the world, and how we can influence them in turn. Our first meeting at SXSW in 2002. How selling CMS systems teaches you the dysfunction at media companies and organizations. Working for the music industry at the dawn of Napster. RFP-EZ. The early days of blogging. </p>
<p>Designing websites for the government—the procurement problem. If we’re pouring all this time into social media, what do we want to get out of it? How big institutions work and how to have an impact on them. Living in “Joe’s Apartment.” </p>
<p>Why, until recently, federal agencies that wanted a blog couldn’t use WordPress or Tumblr and how the State Dept got on Tumblr. Achieving empathy for institutions. Being more thoughtful about what I share and who I amplify on social media. The launch of Thinkup, and a <strong>special offer</strong> exclusively for <stbrong>Big Web Show listeners</strong>.</p>
